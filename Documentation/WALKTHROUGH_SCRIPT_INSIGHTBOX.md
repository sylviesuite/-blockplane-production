## Goal

Show that BlockPlane doesn’t just score materials — it surfaces “why this matters” at the exact moment decisions are made.

---

## INTRO (10–15 seconds)

“BlockPlane is a materials and systems explorer for high-performance buildings. You get clear LIS/RIS scores and comparisons — but what really changes outcomes is what I’m about to show you.”

**[NAVIGATE TO MATERIALS]**

---

## SCENE 1 — ENVELOPE (45–60 seconds)

Open an envelope-related material (insulation or wall assembly).

“Most tools stop at specs and scores. BlockPlane goes one step further.”

Scroll to the section titled: **‘Why this matters — [contextual envelope title]’**

“These are the three failure modes we see over and over in tight homes: moisture failures, air vs vapor confusion, and oversized HVAC. BlockPlane puts that context right next to the material choice — without telling you what to do.”

*Optionally click one insight briefly.*

---

## SCENE 2 — MECHANICAL SYSTEMS (45–60 seconds)

Navigate to a mechanical system (heat pump, furnace, ERV/HRV).

“Same project, different decision. Notice how the guidance changes.”

Scroll to: **‘Why this matters — mechanical comfort’**

“Now we’re talking about load calculations, duct sealing and commissioning, and why comfort complaints happen even when the math looks right. The system adapts to the decision you’re making.”

---

## SCENE 3 — HEALTH & DURABILITY (30–45 seconds)

Open a garage-adjacent or structural material.

“And then there’s the stuff clients feel years later.”

Scroll to: **‘Why this matters — health & long-term durability’**

“These are quiet risks: garage air leakage, thermal bridging, skipped commissioning. BlockPlane surfaces them early — when they’re still easy to fix.”

---

## CLOSE (20–30 seconds)

“BlockPlane doesn’t replace judgment. It makes it easier to get high-performance buildings right the first time — by showing you what you’re actually deciding, at the moment you’re deciding it.”

**End recording.**
