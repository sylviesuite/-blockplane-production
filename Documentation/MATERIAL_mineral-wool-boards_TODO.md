# mineral-wool-boards — Elevation TODOs

Scaffold to bring **exterior mineral wool insulation boards** (rock/mineral wool façade boards) to the same READY standard as hempcrete. Documentation only; no data invented; Steve to fill from real sources.

---

## What this material is

Exterior mineral wool (rock wool) boards used as **continuous insulation** over sheathing — typically 40–80 mm thick — in rain-screen façades, over-cladding, and similar assemblies. Rigid or semi-rigid boards, not cavity-fill batts.

---

## Where it's typically used

- Over framed walls (wood or steel)
- Over masonry (block, brick)
- Retrofit over existing cladding
- Rain-screen and ventilated façade systems

---

## Performance notes vs. alternatives

- **vs. fiberglass batts (cavities):** Continuous layer eliminates thermal bridging at studs; different application (exterior CI vs. cavity). No comparison numbers beyond the table below.
- **vs. cellulose (dense-pack):** Different placement (exterior board vs. cavity); vapor-open in both cases; install and moisture handling differ.
- **vs. polyiso / XPS (rigid foams):** Lower R per inch than foams; vapor-open vs. vapor-closed; fire and moisture behavior differ. No comparison numbers beyond the table below.

---

## Risks / watch-outs

- **Wind-washing** — protect exterior face in ventilated cavities; mesh or cladding details matter.
- **Detailing at fasteners** — thermal bypass and moisture paths at mechanical attachments.
- **Moisture management** — vapor-open; design for drying; avoid trapping moisture behind boards.
- **Fire** — mineral wool is non-combustible; document product ratings where relevant.

---

## CPI / tradeoffs

- **Cost per R** — relative to cavity insulation and to rigid foams; labor vs. materials balance.
- **Install complexity** — board handling, cutting, fastening, and integration with cladding.
- **Labor vs. materials** — capture in narrative; no invented CPI numbers in this doc.

## Why this matters

Exterior mineral wool boards offer continuous insulation that is vapor-open and non-combustible, fitting rain-screen and over-cladding applications where both thermal performance and moisture safety matter. The goal here is to document them with real numbers so builders and designers can compare options without invented data.

## Typical properties — exterior mineral wool boards (façade insulation)

Use these as the only numeric inputs; do not invent others.

| Property                              | Value used           | Notes / source hints                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Density                              | ~45–60 kg/m³         | Ventilated façade / exterior boards often 45–60 kg/m³.                               |
| Thermal conductivity λ               | ~0.035–0.040 W/m·K   | Most façade products are in the 0.035–0.040 W/m·K range.                            |
| R-value per inch                     | ~4.0 per inch        | Derived from λ range above; round to 4.0 for narrative.                              |
| Compressive strength at 10% deformation | ~20–40 kPa        | Typical range for façade boards rated for over-cladding.                             |
| Embodied energy (cradle-to-gate)     | ~30–50 MJ/kg         | Typical literature range for mineral wool; treat as a broad range, not a single value. |
| Embodied energy per m³               | ~1500–2500 MJ/m³     | Density × MJ/kg using the ranges above (e.g. 45×30 ≈ 1350, 60×50 ≈ 3000; 1500–2500 is the narrative range). No new numbers beyond those implied. |

Do not introduce thickness, span, extra R-values, or additional conductivity figures that are not in this table.

## 1. Data audit (LIS / RIS / CPI inputs)

- [ ] Confirm real source for core data (EPD, LCA study, manufacturer, etc.)
- [ ] Replace any generic defaults or category averages
- [ ] Document all assumptions clearly

---

## 2. InsightBox v2

- [ ] At-a-glance summary written
- [ ] LIS / RIS / CPI story (not numbers) clearly explained
- [ ] Tradeoffs vs at least one real alternative named
- [ ] Builder-practical "what to watch" bullets

---

## 3. Documentation parity with hempcrete

- [ ] Short narrative description (use hempcrete's level as reference)
- [ ] Notes on sources + limitations
- [ ] Any caveats about regional data or uncertainty

---

## 4. UI & comparisons

- [ ] Appears correctly in Materials Explorer
- [ ] CPI and alternatives do not mislead
- [ ] Charts render as expected
