# exterior-mineral-wool — Elevation TODOs

Scaffold to bring **exterior mineral wool** (rock/mineral wool insulation boards for walls) to the same READY standard as the other Batch 1 materials. Documentation only; no data invented; all numeric values below are from agreed sources.

## Numeric values (documentation table)

Use these as the **only** numeric inputs for exterior mineral wool in documentation and narrative. Do not introduce other densities, conductivities, R-values, or embodied-energy figures.

| Property                    | Value used / allowed range                           |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Density                    | ≈45 kg/m³ (allowed range 30–80 kg/m³)                |
| Thermal conductivity (λ)   | ≈0.036 W/m·K (allowed range 0.034–0.040 W/m·K)       |
| R-value per inch           | ≈R-4.0 per inch (allowed range R-3.3–R-4.3 per inch) |
| Embodied energy per kg     | ≈30 MJ/kg (allowed range 25–35 MJ/kg)                |
| Embodied energy per m³     | ≈1350 MJ/m³ (from 30 MJ/kg × 45 kg/m³)               |

**Notes**

- **Comparison to fiberglass and rigid foam** — Exterior mineral wool typically offers similar or slightly better R per inch than fiberglass batts and somewhat lower R per inch than XPS or polyiso; it outperforms foams on fire resistance and moisture tolerance (vapor-open, non-combustible). Keep comparisons qualitative beyond the table above.
- **Density** — Exterior boards are generally denser than cavity mineral wool batts; 45 kg/m³ is used here as the working value for exterior and cavity-wall mineral wool boards across the typical 30–80 kg/m³ range.

> **Important:** These are the only numeric values approved for exterior mineral wool in this phase. Do NOT add other R-values, densities, conductivities, or embodied-energy figures. Any LIS/RIS/CPI scoring must come later from the central dataset, not from this TODO file.
