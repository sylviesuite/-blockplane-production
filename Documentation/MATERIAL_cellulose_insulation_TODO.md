# cellulose-insulation — Elevation TODOs

This doc exists to bring **loose-fill / dense-pack cellulose insulation** up to the same READY standard as hempcrete. Only real, sourced values will be used; values below are filled in from agreed sources and will be updated over time as needed.

## Exact numeric values used (documentation & narrative)

| Property               | Value used                                          |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Density                | ~25 kg/m³ (range 20–30 kg/m³; industry EPD)        |
| Thermal conductivity   | ~0.040 W/m·K (range 0.038–0.042 W/m·K)             |
| R-value                | ~3.7 per inch (range 3.5–3.8 per inch)             |
| Embodied energy        | ~2 MJ/kg (range ~1–3 MJ/kg, loose-fill cellulose)  |

No other numeric values are permitted in this doc unless explicitly added to this table from real sources.

## Narrative hooks

Use these as prompts for at-a-glance and InsightBox narrative (do not add new numbers here):

- **Why cellulose is often considered “the greenest of the green”** — recycled content, low embodied energy, carbon storage in paper fiber; keep framing qualitative where numbers are not in the table above.
- **Recycled paper content and carbon sequestration** — high post-consumer content; biogenic carbon in the assembly; end-of-life and recycling pathways.
- **Moisture sensitivity & install quality** — dense-pack vs loose-fill; importance of installer skill and cavity fill; vapor-open behavior and drying.
- **Fire retardants (borates) and indoor air considerations** — typical borate treatment; IAQ and dust during install; no new numeric claims.
- **Comparison framing vs fiberglass and foam** — when cellulose is a better fit; when fiberglass or foam might be chosen instead; **do not** introduce comparison numbers beyond those in the table above.

> **No LIS/RIS/CPI values or additional physical properties were added in this doc. Any new numeric fields for cellulose must come from real sources and be explicitly added to this table first.**
