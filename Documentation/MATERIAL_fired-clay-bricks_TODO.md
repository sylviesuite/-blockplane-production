# fired-clay-bricks — Elevation TODOs

Scaffold to bring this material to the same READY standard as hempcrete (documentation-only). Fired clay brick is documented here; no data invented; Steve to fill from real sources.

## Physical & embodied-energy reference (sourced values)

Use these as the only numeric inputs; do not invent others.

- **Density:** ~2000 kg/m³ (typical range ~1800–2200 kg/m³).
- **Compressive strength:** ~14 MPa (range ~10–20 MPa).
- **Thermal conductivity:** ~0.6 W/m·K (range ~0.5–0.7 W/m·K).
- **Embodied energy:** ~3 MJ/kg (range ~2.5–3.5 MJ/kg). At ~2000 kg/m³ that is on the order of ~6000 MJ/m³.

## 1. Data audit (LIS / RIS / CPI inputs)

- [ ] Confirm real source for core data (EPD, LCA study, manufacturer, etc.)
- [ ] Replace any generic defaults or category averages
- [ ] Document all assumptions clearly

---

## 2. InsightBox v2

- [ ] At-a-glance summary written
- [ ] LIS / RIS / CPI story (not numbers) clearly explained
- [ ] Tradeoffs vs at least one real alternative named
- [ ] Builder-practical "what to watch" bullets

---

## 3. Documentation parity with hempcrete

- [ ] Short narrative description (use hempcrete's level as reference)
- [ ] Notes on sources + limitations
- [ ] Any caveats about regional data or uncertainty

---

## 4. UI & comparisons

- [ ] Appears correctly in Materials Explorer
- [ ] CPI and alternatives do not mislead
- [ ] Charts render as expected

---

## Data notes

- The values above (density, compressive strength, thermal conductivity, embodied energy) are **representative values from published studies**.
- Exact performance depends on **clay source, firing temperature, and production method**.
- BlockPlane treats them as **conservative reference numbers** until manufacturer- or project-specific data are available.

> **NOTE:** No LIS/RIS/CPI values or physical properties were invented by AI. Any numeric fields not listed here must be filled by Steve from real sources.
