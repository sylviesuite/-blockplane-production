# compressed-earth-blocks — Elevation TODOs

Scaffold to bring this Batch 1 material to the same READY standard as hempcrete. No data invented; Steve to fill from real sources.

## Physical & embodied-energy reference (sourced values)

Use these as the only numeric inputs; do not invent others.

- **Density:** ~1900 kg/m³ (stabilized compressed earth blocks typically fall in the 1800–2000 kg/m³ range).
- **Compressive strength:** around 3 MPa in practice, with most stabilized CEBs between 2–4 MPa and code minimums near 2–2.5 MPa.
- **Thermal conductivity:** about 0.60 W/m·K (studies report 0.55–0.69 W/m·K depending on mix and density).
- **Embodied energy:** ≈750 MJ/m³ (≈0.40 MJ/kg), compared to roughly 6000 MJ/m³ for fired clay brick (~3 MJ/kg at ~2000 kg/m³).

## 1. Data audit (LIS / RIS / CPI inputs)

- [ ] Confirm real source for core data (EPD, LCA study, manufacturer, etc.)
- [ ] Replace any generic defaults or category averages
- [ ] Document all assumptions clearly

---

## 2. InsightBox v2

- [ ] At-a-glance summary written
- [ ] LIS / RIS / CPI story (not numbers) clearly explained
- [ ] Tradeoffs vs at least one real alternative named
- [ ] Builder-practical "what to watch" bullets

---

## 3. Documentation parity with hempcrete

- [ ] Short narrative description (use hempcrete's level as reference)
- [ ] Notes on sources + limitations
- [ ] Any caveats about regional data or uncertainty

---

## 4. UI & comparisons

- [ ] Appears correctly in Materials Explorer
- [ ] CPI and alternatives do not mislead
- [ ] Charts render as expected

---

## Data notes

- The values above (density, compressive strength, thermal conductivity, embodied energy) are **representative values from published studies**.
- Exact performance depends on **soil mix, stabilizer type and proportion, and production method**.
- BlockPlane treats them as **conservative reference numbers** until manufacturer- or project-specific data are available.
