# mineral-wool-exterior-boards — Elevation TODOs

Scaffold to bring **exterior mineral wool boards** (e.g. ROCKWOOL Comfortboard-type products) to the same READY standard as the other Batch 1 materials. Documentation only; no data invented; all numeric values below are from agreed sources — Steve to fill or confirm from real sources.

## 1. Overview

Exterior mineral wool boards are rigid or semi-rigid insulation panels made from rock (stone) or slag wool, used as **continuous exterior insulation** over sheathing, as **sheathing replacement** in some assemblies, and in rain-screen and ventilated façade applications. They are vapor-open, non-combustible, and typically installed in thicknesses suited to code-minimum exterior R-value and thermal-bridge control. This doc covers the exterior-board product family (e.g. Comfortboard), not cavity batts or lower-density façade boards.

## 2. Numeric values (documentation table)

Use these as the **only** numeric inputs for exterior mineral wool boards in documentation and narrative. Do not introduce other densities, conductivities, R-values, or embodied-energy figures.

| Property                     | Value used (with range)                             |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Density                      | ~120 kg/m³ (range 110–140 kg/m³)                    |
| Thermal conductivity (λ)     | ~0.038 W/m·K (range 0.035–0.040 W/m·K)             |
| R-value per inch             | ~R-4 per inch (range R-3.7–4.2 per inch)           |
| Embodied energy per kg       | ~12.5 MJ/kg (range 10–15 MJ/kg)                    |
| Embodied energy per m³       | ~1500 MJ/m³ (derived from kg × density, approx.)   |

**Note:** The embodied energy per m³ value is **derived from** embodied energy per kg × density (e.g. 12.5 MJ/kg × 120 kg/m³ ≈ 1500 MJ/m³). It is an approximate derived figure for narrative and comparison, not an independent lab measurement.

Do not introduce extra R-values, λ, density, or embodied-energy figures outside this table.

## 3. Why this matters (builder lens)

- **Density vs handling and fastener choice** — Higher density than cavity batts or some foam boards; affects handling, cutting, and fastener length/type; follow manufacturer guidance for mechanical attachment.
- **λ / R per inch vs code-minimum exterior insulation** — Roughly R-4 per inch supports common code and performance targets for continuous insulation; thickness choices should refer back to the table ranges.
- **Embodied energy vs XPS/polyiso** — Lower embodied energy per kg and per m³ than typical XPS and polyiso; useful for lower-impact envelopes when vapor openness and fire resistance are also priorities. Keep comparisons qualitative; no new numbers.

## 4. Risk / tradeoffs & “what to watch”

- **Fastener length and type** — Ensure fasteners penetrate through the board and into structure; avoid thermal bypass and pull-through.
- **Detailing at openings** — Window and door perimeters, penetrations, and transitions need continuous support and sealing; mineral wool cuts easily but requires proper flashing and drainage.
- **Moisture robustness vs cladding** — Vapor-open boards allow drying; protect from bulk water and ensure drainage plane and cladding details are correct.
- **UV and job-site exposure** — Protect boards from prolonged UV and weather before cladding; follow manufacturer guidance for temporary protection.
- **Code and fire** — Non-combustible; confirm local requirements for ignition barriers and assembly ratings where applicable.

No new numeric values in this section.

## 5. Sources & notes

- Manufacturer datasheets and EPDs for exterior mineral wool board products (e.g. Comfortboard-type).
- Generic building science and enclosure references for continuous insulation and rain-screen design.
- LCI / LCA tables (e.g. ICE or equivalent) for mineral wool insulation, with product-specific EPDs preferred when available.

**No LIS/RIS/CPI values or new physical-property fields were added in this doc. Any future numeric changes must be backed by real sources and added to the table first.**
