### Problem Statement

**Headline:**
> Tired of Carbon Tools That Hide Their Uncertainties?

**Body:**
Most sustainability software makes bold claims about accuracy - but won't show you:
- How confident they are in material matches
- Where their EPD data comes from
- When their data was last updated
- What assumptions they're making

**Result:** You're left guessing what to trust.

### Solution

**Headline:**
> We Do the Opposite: Radical Transparency

**3-Column Feature Grid:**

**Column 1: Confidence Scores**
- Icon: 🟢 Badge
- Headline: "Know What to Verify"

**Column 2: Data Attribution**
- Icon: 📊 Document
- Headline: "See Our Sources"
- Body: "Every EPD shows its source and publication date. Stale data? We flag it. Industry average vs manufacturer EPD? We tell you."

**Column 3: Honest Limitations**
- Icon: ⚠️ Warning
- Headline: "We Show Our Limits"
- Body: "Every report includes data quality metrics and verification recommendations. We document what we can't do, not just what we can."

### FAQ

**Q: How accurate is your carbon data?**

A: We don't claim a single accuracy percentage because it varies by material. Instead, we show confidence scores (High/Medium/Low) on every match. High confidence matches (typically 85-95% name similarity + category match) are likely accurate. Low confidence matches should be verified independently. Every report includes a data quality summary so you know what to trust.

**Q: Can I use this for LEED/BREEAM submissions?**

A: You can use our analysis as a starting point, but certification bodies typically require independent verification. We provide the data quality documentation and verification guides to make that process easier. Think of us as a guidance tool, not a replacement for professional carbon consultants.

**Q: Why do you show "low confidence" matches?**

A: Because hiding uncertainty would be dishonest. A low confidence match with a clear warning is better than a false sense of certainty. You deserve to know when to verify - that's professional-grade transparency.

**Q: How often is your EPD data updated?**

A: Our database is updated quarterly. We show EPD publication dates on every material and flag data >2 years old. For critical materials, we recommend checking manufacturer websites for newer EPDs.

**Q: What if I find an error in your data?**

A: Please report it! We have a "Report Issue" button in the plugin and actively welcome corrections. Honesty means admitting and fixing mistakes quickly.

**Q: Do you guarantee regulatory compliance?**

A: No - and be wary of any tool that does. Carbon regulations vary by jurisdiction and change frequently. We provide methodology documentation and verification guides, but ultimate compliance responsibility rests with you and your consultants.

## 📄 About Page

### Our Story

**Headline:**
> Built by People Tired of Greenwashing

**Body:**

BlockPlane was founded on a simple frustration: sustainability software that makes bold claims but won't show its work.

We've seen too many "AI-powered carbon calculators" that:
- Claim 99% accuracy without proof
- Hide data sources
- Discourage verification
- Oversimplify complex carbon analysis

**We decided to do the opposite.**

What if a carbon tool:
- Showed confidence scores on every result?
- Disclosed EPD sources and publication dates?
- Documented all assumptions?
- Provided verification guides?
- Admitted what it can't do?

**That's BlockPlane.**

We're not perfect - and we'll be the first to tell you where our limitations are. But we believe honesty and professional credibility go hand-in-hand.

**Our mission:** Build trust through transparency, one honest calculation at a time.

### Our Values

**Honesty First**
We never hide uncertainties or overstate capabilities. If we don't know, we say so.

**Professional Defensibility**
Our reports are built to withstand scrutiny - from clients, regulators, and certification bodies.

**Verification Culture**
We encourage users to check our work, especially for critical decisions. Trust, but verify.

**No Greenwashing**
We document limitations, disclose assumptions, and never make vague sustainability claims.

**Continuous Improvement**

**Post 1: Honesty Differentiation**

🛡️ **Unpopular opinion:** Carbon tools should tell you when they're uncertain.

Most sustainability software claims "99% accuracy" but won't show:
- Confidence levels on matches
- EPD publication dates  
- Data sources
- Assumptions made

At BlockPlane, we do the opposite:
✅ Confidence scores on every match
✅ EPD dates visible
✅ Assumptions documented
✅ Verification guides provided

Why? Because honesty and professional credibility go hand-in-hand.

Thoughts? Do you prefer tools that claim perfection or tools that show their limitations?

**Post 2: Verification Culture**

📊 **Hot take:** If your carbon tool discourages verification, that's a red flag.

We built BlockPlane to be checked, not blindly trusted:
- Every report includes data quality metrics
- Low confidence matches get warnings
- We provide step-by-step verification guides
- "Report Issue" button in every dialog

Why encourage users to verify our work?

Because trust without verification isn't professional - it's faith.

And carbon analysis is too important for faith-based approaches.

What do you think - should sustainability tools encourage or discourage verification?

**Post 3: Limitations Documentation**

⚠️ **We just published something unusual:** A detailed list of what our plugin CAN'T do.

8 critical limitations, documented prominently:
- Material matching is probabilistic
- EPD data may be outdated
- Transport distances use defaults
- Only embodied carbon (not operational)
- Database is not exhaustive
- Quantity extraction depends on BIM quality
- No real-time EPD updates
- Lifecycle stages may be incomplete

Why advertise our limitations?

Because architects deserve to know when to verify independently. And honesty builds more trust than hype.

**Tweet 1:**
Carbon tool marketing: "99% accurate!"
Carbon tool reality: *hides confidence levels*

We show High/Medium/Low confidence on every match because honesty > hype.

**Tweet 2:**
Unpopular opinion: Your carbon calculator should tell you when it's uncertain.

We do. Every material match, every report, every error message.

Radical transparency isn't a feature - it's our foundation.
