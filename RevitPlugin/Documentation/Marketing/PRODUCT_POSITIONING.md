# BlockPlane Revit Plugin - Honest Product Positioning

**Last Updated:** 2024-01-15  
**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## 🎯 Core Positioning

**What we are:**
> A guidance tool for sustainable material exploration and preliminary carbon assessment, built on radical transparency.

**What we are NOT:**
> A replacement for professional carbon consultants or a guarantee of regulatory compliance.

---

## 💡 Value Proposition

### The Honest Pitch

**Traditional pitch (what competitors say):**
> "AI-powered carbon analysis with 99% accuracy! Automatically optimize your building's carbon footprint!"

**Our honest pitch:**
> "We help you explore sustainable materials and estimate embodied carbon - with full transparency about confidence levels, data sources, and limitations. When we're uncertain, we tell you."

### Why This Matters

**In an industry full of greenwashing:**
- Competitors hide limitations
- Vendors overstate accuracy
- Tools claim certainty where none exists
- Users are left guessing what to trust

**We do the opposite:**
- Show confidence scores on every match
- Disclose EPD publication dates
- Document all assumptions
- Provide verification guides
- Admit when data is incomplete

**Result:** Users trust us because we're honest, not because we promise perfection.

**Objection:** "Why should I trust your data?"

**Response:** "You shouldn't trust it blindly - that's why we show confidence scores, EPD sources, and provide verification guides. We're designed to be checked, not blindly trusted."

---

**Objection:** "Your competitors claim higher accuracy."

**Response:** "They claim it, but do they prove it? We show confidence levels on every match. When we're uncertain, we tell you. That's more honest than claiming perfection."

---

**Objection:** "This seems complicated with all the verification steps."

**Response:** "Carbon analysis IS complicated - anyone claiming it's simple is oversimplifying. We provide verification guides because we respect the complexity and want you to make informed decisions."

---

**Objection:** "Can I use this for LEED submissions?"
