# Canonical Insight — Rammed Earth + Hempcrete vs 2×6 Stud Wall

## Summary

ResiliMass-style assemblies that pair structural rammed earth with interior hempcrete differ sharply from conventional 2×6 stud walls. The rammed earth exterior delivers thick thermal mass, structural resilience, and airtightness, while the hempcrete infill contributes humidity buffering and a vapor-open finish. The 2×6 stud wall trades mass for speed, cost-effectiveness, and the confidence of established practices; it relies on cavity insulation, sheathing, and air sealing to reach performance targets. This comparison highlights how each system balances thermal performance, carbon, and constructability in North American contexts.

## Assembly Highlights

- **Rammed Earth + Hempcrete**: 6" stabilized rammed earth exterior (load-bearing, thermal mass) + 4" continuous mineral wool/wood-fiber insulation + 6" interior hempcrete (non-structural, vapor-open). Anchors set during the pour secure the inner layers without carrying gravity loads. Modeled center-of-wall R ~R-33–35; climate band CZ5–CZ7. Experimental but buildable with specialized crews.
- **2×6 Stud Wall**: Standard assembly with exterior cladding, WRB, sheathing, 2×6 framing at 16" o.c., cavity mineral wool or fiberglass, and gypsum finish. Whole-wall R typically R-15 to R-18; widely permitted and easily sourced.

## Thermal + Comfort Performance

The ResiliMass build gives higher modeled R through continuous insulation and eliminates stud thermal bridges, while the mass exterior moderates swings and the hempcrete interior absorbs humidity. 2×6 walls have less mass, respond more quickly to outdoor changes, and need meticulous air sealing to avoid cold-wall sensations.

## Lifecycle & Embodied Carbon

The mass-plus-bio stack increases initial embodied mass but leans on local earth, low-carbon binder, and hempcrete to keep LIS manageable; continuous insulation offsets bridging. The stud wall uses kiln-dried lumber, synthetic insulation, sheathing, and drywall—components with well-understood supply chains that still carry synthetic intensity but benefit from widespread scale.

## Regenerative & Resilience Considerations

Rammed earth + hempcrete score well on RIS thanks to biogenic materials, mass, and vapor openness, though the system is still gathering field data. The stud wall trades some resilience for predictability; with proper detailing, it resists fire and moisture, but risk grows when detailing slips.

## Constructability & Cost

The mass assembly requires engineers, rammed-earth crews, hempcrete installers, and plan coordination; costs are higher and schedules longer, but the wall can be robust once the workflow is tuned. 2×6 walls remain the low-friction path: crews, inspectors, and materials are ubiquitous, making budgeting and permitting straightforward.

## When to Consider Each

- **Rammed Earth + Hempcrete** for pilots, custom homes, or buildings that want thermal mass, moisture buffering, and a regenerative narrative and can support specialized trades.
- **2×6 Stud Walls** for production housing, remodels, and high-volume builds where speed, cost, and code familiarity dominate.

## Notes

This document is canonical reference material, not code guidance. For experimental mass builds, coordinate with engineers and verify local approvals; 2×6 walls remain the baseline for most projects.
