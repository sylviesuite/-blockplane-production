## Insight #2  
### Fiberglass Batt vs Dense-Pack Cellulose Wall Insulation

**Overview**  
This comparison looks at two common cavity insulation options for framed walls: standard **fiberglass batts** and **dense-pack cellulose**. Both can hit similar R-values on paper, but they behave differently in terms of embodied impact, installation quality, and long-term performance.

## Why the scores land where they do

### Lifecycle Impact Score (LIS)  
Fiberglass batts start with an energy-intensive manufacturing process:  
- glass or sand melted in furnaces  
- spun into fibers and bound with resins  
- packaged with facing and plastic wrap  

Dense-pack cellulose is typically made from recycled paper with:  
- comparatively low-temperature processing  
- borate fire and pest treatment  
- minimal additional packaging  

Over a full lifecycle:
- **Fiberglass** tends to carry higher **manufacturing energy** but modest weight and volume.  
- **Cellulose** benefits from recycled content and carbon stored in wood fiber, with impacts driven mostly by additives, transport, and blower equipment.

If both are installed well and left undisturbed, LIS tends to favor **cellulose** for lower embodied impact per unit of thermal performance.

### Regenerative Impact Score (RIS)  
RIS separates the two more clearly.

- **Dense-Pack Cellulose**
  - Uses recycled feedstock (often 75–85% reclaimed paper)
  - Stores biogenic carbon for the life of the building
  - Can be removed and re-used or composted in some end-of-life scenarios
  - Good acoustic performance and draft control when properly installed  
  - Typically lands in the *Resilient* tier when moisture is managed well

- **Fiberglass Batt**
  - Inert and non-combustible, but not circular by default
  - More prone to performance loss from gaps, compression, and poor fit
  - End-of-life is usually landfill with limited recovery
  - Relies on petrochemical binders and facings in many products  
  - Typically scores in the *Transitional* range: better than foams, weaker on circularity

RIS favors materials that **recycle waste streams and store carbon** instead of relying on petrochemical components.

## The real tradeoffs

- **Installation quality**:  
  - Cellulose requires a crew that understands density and netting; when done well, it fills cavities and irregular spaces.  
  - Fiberglass batts are simpler to install but more vulnerable to sloppy cutting and gaps.

- **Moisture behavior**:  
  - Cellulose can buffer some moisture but must be detailed to dry—bad details can lead to risk.  
  - Fiberglass does not hold much moisture but can hide condensation against cold surfaces.

- **Cost and availability**:  
  - In many markets, fiberglass is the lowest-bid baseline.  
  - Cellulose is often similar or slightly higher in cost once labor and equipment are included, and may not be available everywhere.

- **Retrofit vs new construction**:  
  - Dense-pack excels in retrofit walls and hard-to-reach cavities.  
  - Batts are more common in straightforward new framing where labor is unskilled or rotating.

## When this choice makes sense

Choose **Dense-Pack Cellulose** when:
- you care about recycled content and carbon storage,
- you have access to a competent installer,
- sound control and draft reduction matter,
- you are targeting *Resilient* or better RIS tiers.

Choose **Fiberglass Batts** when:
- lowest upfront material cost is critical,
- crews are already set up with batt workflow,
- the framing layout is regular and easy to insulate,
- supply constraints make cellulose difficult to source.

---

## Considerable alternatives

If neither option is ideal for the project, consider:
- wood-fiber batts or boards in high-performance assemblies,
- blown-in fiberglass in netted cavities (better fit than batts),
- hybrid approaches combining cellulose with exterior continuous insulation to manage moisture and thermal bridging.

These options can move the project further into **low-impact, high-performance** territory while staying familiar to most contractors.

## Takeaway

On a spec sheet, fiberglass batts and dense-pack cellulose can look nearly identical.  
BlockPlane surfaces the difference:

- **Fiberglass** optimizes for **price and familiarity**, with moderate lifecycle and weak circularity.  
- **Cellulose** optimizes for **recycled content, carbon storage, and tighter real-world performance**, at the cost of installer skill and, sometimes, availability.

The better choice depends less on R-value and more on **who is installing it and how long you expect the building to serve.**
