    "overview": "This comparison evaluates a hybrid wall assembly using rammed earth for structure and hempcrete for insulation against a conventional 2×6 wood-framed wall. Both meet enclosure requirements, but they behave very differently over time.",
    "why_it_scores_this_way": {
      "LIS": "Rammed Earth + Hempcrete carries higher initial impact due to labor intensity and binder production, but benefits from minimal processing, long service life, and low maintenance. The 2×6 wall begins with lower impact but accumulates lifecycle cost through processed materials, replacements, and maintenance.",
      "RIS": "Rammed Earth + Hempcrete scores higher due to durability, fire resistance, moisture buffering, indoor air quality, partial carbon storage, and reduced end-of-life waste. The 2×6 wall remains adaptable and familiar but relies more heavily on managed forests and petrochemical insulation."

    "tradeoffs": [
      "15–30% higher upfront cost in North America",
      "Specialized labor and sequencing",
