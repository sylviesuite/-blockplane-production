  "sections": {
    "overview": "This comparison looks at two residential window strategies: standard double-pane vinyl windows and triple-pane high-performance windows. Both meet modern codes, but they diverge in energy performance, durability, and long-term impact.",
    "why_it_scores_this_way": {
      "LIS": "Double-pane vinyl windows rely on simpler manufacturing and lighter transport, but they lose heat faster, need earlier replacement, and lean on PVC components. Triple-pane windows add glass, coatings, and heavier frames, yet they dramatically reduce operational draw, extend service life, and shrink HVAC runtime.",
      "RIS": "Triple-pane windows deliver better thermal comfort, condensation resistance, and lower failure rates, while being easier to repair. Double-pane vinyl remains familiar but offers limited circularity and carries PVC-related toxicity concerns."
    },
    "tradeoffs": [
      "Triple-pane windows cost 20–40% more upfront.",
      "Double-pane vinyl windows are easier to source and install.",
      "Installation quality is critical for both—air sealing and flashing matter.",
      "Triple-pane windows deliver comfort benefits immediately but rely on climate to achieve payback."

      "choose_alternative_when": [
        "Choose double-pane vinyl when upfront budget is tight.",
        "Choose double-pane vinyl when replacement is expected soon.",
        "Choose double-pane vinyl when fast availability and simple installation are essential.",
        "Choose double-pane vinyl when performance targets remain modest."
