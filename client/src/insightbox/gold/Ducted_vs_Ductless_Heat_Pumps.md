## InsightBox — Ducted vs Ductless Heat Pumps

### At a glance

This comparison looks at ducted and ductless heat pump systems.

Both use the same core technology, but they distribute heat very differently — affecting comfort, efficiency, install complexity, and retrofit feasibility.

**Core idea:**  
Ducts trade simplicity for distribution. Ductless trades uniformity for control.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Ducted heat pumps**
- Additional material and energy for ductwork
- Losses from leakage and thermal bridging
- Centralized equipment footprint

**Ductless heat pumps**
- Fewer materials overall
- No duct losses
- Multiple indoor units increase component count

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Ductless systems tend to have lower lifecycle losses, especially in retrofits.

---

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Comfort & zoning**
- Ductless excels at room-by-room control
- Ducted systems provide more uniform whole-house delivery

**Envelope interaction**
- Ductless pairs well with airtight envelopes
- Ducted performance depends heavily on duct sealing and layout

**Resilience**
- Multiple ductless heads offer redundancy
- Single ducted system is a single point of failure

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Ductless systems reward tight, efficient buildings and adaptive living patterns.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Ductless often cheaper for small homes and retrofits
- Ducted adds cost through ducts and labor

**Operating cost**
- Ductless avoids distribution losses
- Ducted systems can be efficient if ducts are inside conditioned space

**Best-fit cases**
- Ductless: retrofits, additions, high-performance homes
- Ducted: new construction, occupants wanting uniform comfort

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Ductless delivers more impact per dollar when ducts are hard to justify.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Ductless heat pumps**
  - High efficiency
  - Excellent zoning
  - Ideal for retrofits and tight envelopes

- **Ducted heat pumps**
  - Cleaner aesthetics
  - Even distribution
  - Require excellent duct design to perform well

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *If you wouldn't build great ducts, don't build ducts at all.*
