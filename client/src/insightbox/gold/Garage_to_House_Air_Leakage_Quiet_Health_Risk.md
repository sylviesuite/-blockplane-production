## InsightBox — Garage-to-House Air Leakage: A Quiet Health Risk

### At a glance

This InsightBox addresses **air leakage from attached garages into living space** — a pathway that can introduce vehicle exhaust, dust, and other contaminants with little visible sign until health or air-quality issues appear.

Garages are often unconditioned, contain combustion sources (cars, lawn equipment), and may store chemicals or particulates. The boundary between garage and house is sometimes treated as secondary to the main envelope. Gaps at doors, walls, duct runs, or penetrations can allow garage air to enter the living zone. The risk is cumulative and often unnoticed until it becomes a problem.

**Core idea:**  
Garage-to-house leakage is a specific, controllable pathway. Sealing and pressurization at that boundary protect indoor air quality and health without requiring alarm; it requires attention.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**How garage air enters**
- **Doors:** The door between garage and house is the most obvious path. Gaps at threshold, jamb, or head, or a door that is not gasketed or self-closing, can allow air exchange whenever the garage door is open or when pressure or temperature differences drive flow.
- **Walls and ceiling:** Penetrations for wires, ducts, pipes, or mechanicals that serve both garage and house can bypass the separation. So can gaps at top plates, sill plates, or behind finishes.
- **Ducts:** If return ducts or supply runs are in the garage or share a chase with the garage, leakage can pull garage air into the distribution system and deliver it to living space.

**What can come with that air**
- Vehicle exhaust (including carbon monoxide), particulates, and vapors from stored fuels or chemicals. In cold climates, cars may idle in the garage; in all climates, opening the garage door can draw outdoor pollutants in, which can then migrate inside.
- The concentration in the garage is often higher than in the house. Even small leakage can noticeably degrade indoor air quality over time.

**Consequences**
- Health effects depend on contaminant type, concentration, and occupant sensitivity. The building may perform well on paper while this single pathway undermines air quality.
- Remediation after the fact — finding and sealing leaks, relocating ducts, or adding ventilation to dilute — is more costly than building the separation correctly from the start.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Garage-to-house leakage is a defined pathway with real consequences for air quality and health. Sealing the boundary and keeping ducts and penetrations out of the garage (or sealed from it) reduces risk for the life of the building.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Occupant health**
- Reducing garage-to-house flow reduces exposure to exhaust and other contaminants. For sensitive occupants or dense occupancy, the benefit is significant.
- The fix is building science and detailing, not lifestyle change: a well-sealed boundary works regardless of how the garage is used.

**Durability**
- Contaminants and humidity from the garage can also affect materials in adjacent walls or ceiling. A clear separation supports long-term durability of those assemblies.

**Unintended consequences**
- Relying only on exhaust fans or "don’t idle in the garage" does not remove the pathway. The boundary must be continuous and verified. Ventilation in the house can dilute but not replace a tight separation.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Treating the garage–house boundary as part of the health and durability strategy protects occupants and the building. It is a quiet risk until it isn’t; the fix is straightforward if planned.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Prevention**
- Sealing the house–garage door (gaskets, threshold, self-closer), sealing penetrations in the common wall and ceiling, and keeping ducts out of the garage or in sealed chases add modest cost at construction.
- The incremental cost is small compared to the cost of testing, diagnosis, and remediation later, or to the cost of health impacts.

**Verification**
- Visual inspection and checklist for the boundary are low cost. Blower-door or pressure testing across the boundary can confirm separation when the goal is high indoor air quality.

**Value**
- Investment in garage–house separation typically has strong cost-per-impact for health and air quality. It is a one-time build decision that pays off for the life of the building.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Sealing and verifying the garage–house boundary usually delivers high impact per dollar for air quality and health. It is under-prioritized in many builds.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Where leakage occurs**
  - Door between garage and house (gaps, no gasket, not self-closing)
  - Penetrations in common walls and ceiling
  - Ducts in garage or shared chases

- **Why it matters**
  - Garage air can contain exhaust, particulates, and vapors
  - Small, continuous leakage can affect indoor air quality and health
  - The pathway is controllable with attention to the boundary

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *The garage is outside. Seal the boundary like you mean it — door, penetrations, and ducts. What’s in the garage should stay there.*
