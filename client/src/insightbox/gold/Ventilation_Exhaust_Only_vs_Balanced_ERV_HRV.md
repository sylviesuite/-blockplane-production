## InsightBox — Ventilation: Exhaust-Only vs Balanced (ERV / HRV)

### At a glance

All airtight buildings need **intentional ventilation**.

This comparison looks at:
- **Exhaust-only ventilation** (bath fans, kitchen hoods, negative pressure)
- **Balanced ventilation** using **HRVs or ERVs**

**Core idea:**  
Ventilation is not just about fresh air — it's about **pressure balance, moisture control, and energy recovery**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Exhaust-only systems**
- Low equipment and install cost
- Increase uncontrolled infiltration
- Can pull moisture and pollutants into assemblies

**Balanced ERV/HRV systems**
- Higher embodied energy upfront
- Recover heat (and sometimes moisture)
- Reduce heating and cooling demand over decades

**Long-term performance**
- Balanced systems reduce envelope stress
- Less risk of condensation and durability failures

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> ERV/HRV systems often outperform exhaust-only systems over a building's full lifespan.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Indoor air quality**
- Balanced systems deliver consistent fresh air to living spaces
- Exhaust-only systems rely on random leakage paths

**Moisture management**
- ERVs help control indoor humidity
- HRVs excel in cold climates with dry winter air

**System harmony**
- Balanced ventilation supports airtight, vapor-aware assemblies
- Reduces reliance on "accidental ventilation"

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Balanced ventilation creates calmer buildings with healthier indoor environments.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Exhaust-only: cheap and simple
- ERV/HRV: higher initial cost and design effort

**Operating cost**
- ERV/HRV systems reduce heating and cooling loads
- Lower risk of mold, comfort complaints, and callbacks

**Value per dollar**
- ERV/HRV systems deliver more impact per dollar over time

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> ERV/HRV systems cost more upfront but usually win on comfort, durability, and energy savings.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Exhaust-only ventilation**
  - Simple and inexpensive
  - Works in leaky buildings
  - Can create pressure and moisture problems in tight homes

- **Balanced ERV/HRV ventilation**
  - Designed for airtight construction
  - Improves comfort, air quality, and durability
  - Aligns with low-energy, high-performance buildings

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *The tighter the building, the more intentional the ventilation must be.*
