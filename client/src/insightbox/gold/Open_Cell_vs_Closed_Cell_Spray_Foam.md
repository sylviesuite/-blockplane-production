## InsightBox — Open-Cell vs Closed-Cell Spray Foam

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **open-cell spray polyurethane foam (ocSPF)** versus **closed-cell spray polyurethane foam (ccSPF)** for walls, roofs, and tricky air-sealing locations.

Both are site-mixed petrochemical foams that deliver strong air-sealing. The real differences show up in **density, R-value per inch, moisture behavior, and long-term risk**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied energy & carbon**

- **Closed-Cell Foam**
  - Higher density and more material per inch.
  - Historically used **high-GWP blowing agents** (varies by product and era).
  - Typically **highest embodied carbon per inch of R** in common insulation choices.
- **Open-Cell Foam**
  - Lower density; uses less material for the same volume.
  - Lower R-value per inch but usually **lower embodied impact** than closed-cell.
  - Still petrochemical and energy intensive compared to cellulose or mineral wool.

**Transport & installation**

- Both arrive as chemical components in drums and are mixed on-site with heated equipment.
- Both require **specialized rigs, trained crews, and careful quality control**.
- Installation is energy-intensive and can generate waste during trimming.

**End of life**

- Both foams are **bonded to framing and sheathing**, making selective demolition and material recovery difficult.
- Typically become mixed construction waste with limited recycling options.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **Open-cell foam has a lower lifecycle burden** than closed-cell, but both are high-impact compared to bio-based or mineral insulations.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & drying behavior**

- **Open-Cell Foam**
  - Vapor-permeable; can allow assemblies to **dry through the foam**.
  - Acts as an air barrier but not a true vapor barrier.
  - Can absorb and hold some moisture; must be kept out of bulk-water paths.
- **Closed-Cell Foam**
  - **Vapor-resistant**; can act as both air and vapor control layer.
  - Useful where you need a **combined water, air, and vapor barrier**, but can also **trap moisture** if placed incorrectly.
  - Adds some structural stiffness to assemblies.

**Flexibility, repair, and health**

- Both foams:
  - Rely on isocyanate chemistry with **installer health risks** if PPE and ventilation are poor.
  - Create assemblies that are **hard to modify later** (wiring/plumbing changes are more invasive).
- Open-cell is easier to cut and remove if repairs are needed.
- Closed-cell’s rigidity makes small mistakes harder to fix after curing.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Open-cell foam scores slightly higher** on regenerative metrics due to vapor permeability and easier reversibility. Closed-cell excels only where a robust, single-layer control strategy is absolutely necessary and very carefully detailed.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Closed-Cell Foam**
  - **Highest installed cost per inch**.
  - Often used thinly to meet code or as a “flash-and-batt” layer.
- **Open-Cell Foam**
  - Lower cost per filled cavity than closed-cell.
  - Often competitive with other high-performance assemblies when air-sealing benefits are counted.

**Energy savings & payback**

- Both can dramatically reduce air leakage when installed correctly.
- Closed-cell’s higher R per inch helps in **space-constrained locations** (rim joists, narrow cavities, low-slope roofs).
- Open-cell can achieve strong performance at lower cost where cavity depth is available.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> **Open-cell foam usually delivers better cost-per-impact** when foam is already being used. Closed-cell only makes sense where **space is tight or moisture conditions demand it**.

### Summary Takeaway

- **If you’re already in foam territory:**
  - Default to **open-cell spray foam** for most assemblies where you want air control and can allow vapor to move.
- **Reserve closed-cell for:**
  - **Rim joists, below-grade, flood or high-exposure zones, and extreme space constraints** where a thin, robust water/air/vapor layer is required and detailing is carefully engineered.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Use spray foam as a **surgical tool**, not a blanket approach.
  - Double-check dew point and drying paths whenever closed-cell is part of the design.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you must use foam, start with open-cell. Reach for closed-cell only when the building physics truly leave you no other choice.*
