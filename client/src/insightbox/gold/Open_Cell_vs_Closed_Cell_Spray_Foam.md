## InsightBox — Open-Cell vs Closed-Cell Spray Foam

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two site-applied spray foam options:
- **Open-cell foam (ocSPF)** — lower density, vapor-permeable, lower R per inch; less material per volume
- **Closed-cell foam (ccSPF)** — higher density, vapor-resistant, higher R per inch; can add structural stiffness

Both are petrochemical foams that seal air effectively. Differences show up in **embodied impact, R per inch, moisture behavior, and cost**.

**Core idea:**  
Open-cell usually has lower embodied impact and cost; closed-cell delivers more R per inch and can act as air + vapor control in one layer—use it where space or moisture conditions justify the premium.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied impact & material intensity**
- Closed-cell: **higher density**, more **material per inch**; historically **high-GWP blowing agents** (varies by product and era); often **among the highest embodied carbon per inch of R** in common insulations.
- Open-cell: **lower density**, less material per volume; **lower R per inch** but typically **lower embodied impact and material intensity** than closed-cell. Still petrochemical and energy-intensive compared to cellulose or mineral wool.

**Thermal performance & install**
- Closed-cell delivers **more R per inch**; open-cell needs greater thickness for the same R. Both arrive as components, are mixed on-site with heated equipment, and need specialized rigs and trained crews; install is energy-intensive. Both are bonded to framing and sheathing—demolition and recovery are difficult; typically mixed construction waste.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Open-cell typically has **lower lifecycle burden** than closed-cell (density, blowing agents, material intensity per R). Both are high-impact compared to bio-based or mineral options.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & vapor**
- Open-cell: **vapor-permeable**; assemblies can **dry through the foam**. Air barrier but not a vapor barrier; can absorb some moisture—keep out of bulk-water paths.
- Closed-cell: **vapor-resistant**; can act as air and vapor control in one layer. Useful as a combined water/air/vapor barrier where appropriate, but can **trap moisture** if placement or drying paths are wrong.

**Structural & fire**
- Closed-cell **adds stiffness** to assemblies (e.g. shear, racking); open-cell does not. Both rely on isocyanate chemistry—**installer health risks** if PPE and ventilation are poor. Fire performance varies by product and thickness; closed-cell is often used where a thermal barrier or ignition barrier is required—check codes and listings.

**Repair & reversibility**
- Both make **later changes** (wiring, plumbing) more invasive. Open-cell is easier to cut and remove for repairs; closed-cell’s rigidity makes small mistakes harder to fix after cure.

**Risk if misapplied**
- Closed-cell can **trap moisture** and stress assemblies when drying paths are ignored or dew point is wrong. Open-cell in **bulk-water paths** (e.g. below-grade, flood zone) can absorb water and lose R; keep out of direct wetting.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Open-cell often scores better on **vapor permeability, drying, and reversibility**. Closed-cell fits where **air/vapor/structural control in one layer** is needed and detailing is careful; misapplied, both can increase moisture or durability risk.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Cost per R & up-front**
- Open-cell: **lower cost per filled cavity** and **lower cost per R** where cavity depth allows; often competitive with other high-performance options when air-sealing is counted.
- Closed-cell: **highest installed cost per inch** and per R; often used thin to meet code or as a flash-and-batt layer.

**When the closed-cell premium pays off**
- Closed-cell’s **higher R per inch** pays off in **space-constrained locations** (rim joists, narrow cavities, low-slope roofs) or where a single-layer vapor/structural benefit is required. Open-cell often delivers strong performance at lower cost where cavity depth allows and vapor openness is acceptable.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Open-cell typically has **better cost per R** and lower upfront cost. Closed-cell tends to pay off where **space is tight or vapor/structural conditions** justify the premium.

### Performance notes

- Blowing-agent GWP and embodied carbon vary by product and vintage; check EPDs. For closed-cell, **dew point and drying paths** matter—incorrect placement can trap moisture. Verify drying direction (interior or exterior) for the assembly.

### Installation & risk

- Both need **trained crews, PPE, and ventilation**; isocyanate exposure is a real risk. Quality depends on temperature, humidity, and application technique; trimming generates waste. Closed-cell mistakes are harder to correct after cure; open-cell is easier to cut and patch.

---

### Summary Takeaway

- **Open-cell foam**:
  - When **vapor openness, drying, and lower embodied impact** matter; air control with vapor-permeable layer
  - Lower cost per R and per filled cavity; easier to repair or modify
- **Closed-cell foam**:
  - When **R per inch, vapor control, or structural contribution** are required (e.g. rim joists, below-grade, tight cavities, flood zones)
  - Higher cost per R; dew point and drying paths must be designed

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Open-cell for vapor openness and lower embodied impact; closed-cell when R per inch, vapor control, or structural benefit are required by design or code.*
