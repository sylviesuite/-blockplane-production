## InsightBox — Foundations: Vapor Barriers & Capillary Breaks (What Actually Matters)

### At a glance

This InsightBox explains **what really matters below slabs and around foundations**:

- **Vapor barriers** (stop water vapor movement)
- **Capillary breaks** (stop liquid water wicking through materials)

Most long-term foundation problems come from **missing or poorly detailed layers**, not from the insulation choice alone.

## Key Concepts

### Vapor barrier vs capillary break

- **Vapor barrier**
  - A material with **very low vapor permeability** (e.g., polyethylene sheet).
  - Purpose: slow or stop **water vapor** moving into the building.

- **Capillary break**
  - A layer or material that **stops liquid water from wicking** upward through tiny pores or cracks.
  - Examples:
    - Coarse, clean gravel
    - Non-absorptive membranes
    - Metal or plastic flashings.

**Short version:**  
Vapor barriers deal with **moisture in the air**. Capillary breaks deal with **moisture in the water table and soil**.

## Under-Slab Conditions

### Good under-slab stack (new construction)

A robust under-slab build-up typically looks like:

1. Compacted subgrade
2. Capillary break (clean, washed gravel)
3. **Vapor barrier** (taped seams, sealed at penetrations)
4. Optional insulation (above or below vapor barrier, per design)
5. Concrete slab

**Why it works**
- Gravel breaks capillary rise.
- Vapor barrier stops moisture vapor from entering the slab and interior.
- Insulation controls heat flow and reduces condensation risk.

---

## Common failure patterns

- Missing vapor barrier or thin, torn poly.
- Poly placed over rough fill with no protection → punctures everywhere.
- No capillary break under slab, allowing ground moisture to wick up.

**Result**
- Damp slabs
- Musty basements
- Flooring failures (especially wood, vinyl, and carpet).

## Foundation Walls & Footings

### Capillary breaks at footings

- Concrete is porous; it can wick water upward from footings.
- **Horizontal capillary break** between footing and wall:
  - Fluid-applied membrane
  - Sheet membrane
  - Metal or plastic cap (compatible with structure and code).

**Why it matters**
- Reduces rising damp into walls.
- Protects interior finishes and insulation.

---

### Vapor control on foundation walls

- **Exterior:**
  - Waterproofing or dampproofing manages **bulk water** and vapor.
  - Paired with drainage (stone + pipe + filter fabric).
- **Interior:**
  - Rigid foam can act as a **vapor retarder** if used continuously.
  - Interior finishes must respect drying paths (e.g., no poly trapping moisture against cold concrete).

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

- Missing or weak moisture control:
  - Drives:
    - Mold remediation
    - Flooring replacement
    - Efflorescence cleanup
    - Structural repairs.
- Proper vapor and capillary control:
  - Extends the life of:
    - Slabs
    - Floor finishes
    - Wall assemblies.

**LIS snapshot:**  
A good vapor barrier and capillary break can **save more carbon and cost over time** than increasing slab thickness or insulation value alone.

---

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

- Dry foundations:
  - Protect indoor air quality.
  - Reduce material turnover.
  - Support long-term re-use and adaptation.
- Wet foundations:
  - Lock buildings into cycles of:
    - Repair
    - Replacement
    - Premature demolition.

**RIS verdict:**  
Controlling moisture at the foundation is **foundational** to regenerative building — it protects everything above.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- Gravel capillary break and robust vapor barrier:
  - Low material cost.
  - Modest labor when planned early.
- Capillary breaks at footings and walls:
  - Small premium relative to structural costs.

### Lifetime value

- Drastically reduced:
  - Mold claims
  - Floor failures
  - “Damp basement” complaints.

**CPI verdict:**  
Vapor barriers and capillary breaks offer **exceptional cost-per-impact**. Few line items deliver more protection per dollar.

## Summary Takeaway

- **Under slabs:**
  - Always include:
    - Capillary break (clean gravel)
    - Robust vapor barrier (taped and sealed).
- **At foundations:**
  - Provide capillary breaks at:
    - Footing-to-wall interface
    - Bottom of framing (sill gasket or membrane).
- **Design guidance:**
  - Treat moisture control at foundations as **non-optional infrastructure**, not a place to save money.
  - Remember: you can fix insulation later; fixing a wet slab or wall is far more expensive.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If water can wick or vapor can sneak in, it will — and it will pick the worst place to show up. Break the capillary path, and stop the vapor early.*
