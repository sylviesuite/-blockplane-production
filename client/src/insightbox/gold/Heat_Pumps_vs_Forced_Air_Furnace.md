## InsightBox — Heat Pumps vs Forced-Air Furnaces (Gas/Propane)

### At a glance

This InsightBox compares **modern electric heat pumps** to **conventional forced-air furnaces** (gas or propane), focusing on:
- Energy performance
- Comfort
- Carbon and lifecycle impact (LIS)
- Cost-per-impact (CPI)
- Practical retrofit and new-build choices

Both use ducted air delivery in many homes — the **real difference is how they make heat.**

## How They Actually Work

### Heat Pump (Air-Source, Ducted or Ductless)

- Moves heat using a **refrigerant cycle**:
  - Extracts heat from outdoor air
  - Delivers it indoors
- Can also run in reverse for **cooling (AC)**.
- Efficiency is measured as **COP** (Coefficient of Performance):
  - COP 2–4+ → 2–4 units of heat per unit of electricity.

### Forced-Air Furnace (Gas/Propane)

- **Burns fuel** to create heat.
- Uses a heat exchanger and blower.
- Efficiency measured as **AFUE** (Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency):
  - Typical range: 80–98%.

**Key difference:**  
Furnaces **make** heat from fuel.  
Heat pumps **move** heat using electricity.

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Heat Pump

- Operational:
  - Often **much lower site energy use** than combustion.
  - LIS depends on:
    - Grid mix (clean vs fossil-heavy)
    - Envelope quality.
- Embodied:
  - Similar to or slightly higher than furnace + AC combo.
  - But **one unit can replace both heater and AC.**

**LIS snapshot:**  
In most regions, a heat pump delivers **substantial lifecycle carbon reductions**, especially as grids decarbonize.

---

### Forced-Air Furnace

- Operational:
  - Direct fossil combustion on-site.
  - Even at high AFUE, all heat comes from burning fuel.
- Embodied:
  - Moderate equipment impact.
  - Often paired with a separate AC system (extra equipment).

**LIS snapshot:**  
LIS is dominated by **fuel burned every year**, not by the furnace itself.

---

## Comfort & Practical Performance

### Heat Pump

**Pros**
- More even, **low-temperature, longer run cycles** → less on/off blasting.
- Integrated heating and cooling.
- Good dehumidification in cooling mode.

**Cons (if poorly sized or in extreme cold)**
- May rely on electric resistance backup → high operating cost if envelope is weak.
- Mis-sized systems can short-cycle and feel “cool” at registers.

---

### Forced-Air Furnace

**Pros**
- High supply temperatures → “hot air” feel.
- Familiar to most installers and homeowners.
- Can be cheaper to run in:
  - Very cold climates **and**
  - Where electricity is very expensive and gas is cheap.

**Cons**
- Short, hot cycles → more stratification and drafts.
- Requires separate AC for cooling.
- Flue gas and combustion safety require careful design and maintenance.

**Comfort snapshot:**  
Heat pumps excel at **steady comfort**; furnaces excel at **blast-and-coast** heat.

---

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Heat Pump

- Aligns with:
  - Grid decarbonization
  - Electrification policies.
- Reduces:
  - On-site combustion
  - Local NOx/CO risks.
- Supports:
  - Future integration with solar + storage.

### Furnace

- Locks building into:
  - Fuel supply
  - Venting
  - Combustion safety hardware.
- Harder to decarbonize without major changes.

**RIS verdict:**  
Heat pumps better support **long-term, low-carbon, flexible buildings.**

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Heat pumps**
  - Equipment often higher than a basic furnace alone.
  - But can **replace both furnace + AC**:
    - One outdoor unit
    - One indoor unit (in many setups).
- **Furnace**
  - Lower cost for heating-only.
  - Full system cost must include **separate AC** if cooling is needed.

### Operating cost (very context-dependent)

- Where electricity prices are moderate and gas/propane is expensive:
  - Heat pumps can be **significantly cheaper** to run.
- Where gas is very cheap and electricity is expensive:
  - Furnaces may keep a short-term operating cost edge.
- Propane:
  - Often expensive → heat pumps usually win strongly on CPI.

**CPI verdict:**  
Heat pumps usually deliver better **cost-per-impact** when:
- The envelope is decent.
- Electricity prices are not extreme.
- Cooling is needed anyway.

---

## Envelope & Climate Considerations

- In **cold/mixed climates**:
  - Use **cold-climate heat pumps**, sized and installed correctly.
  - Good envelope + right equipment → heat pump can fully replace furnace.
- In **very leaky homes**:
  - Any system will be expensive to operate.
  - First dollars go furthest in **tightening the envelope**.

**Integration rule:**  
> Don’t swap a furnace for a heat pump just to “go electric” — fix the envelope and ducts so the heat pump isn’t fighting uphill.

---

## Retrofit vs New Construction

### Retrofits

- If ducts and furnace are in place:
  - Ducted heat pump retrofit is straightforward when:
    - Ducts are inside envelope or well sealed.
  - Dual-fuel setups (heat pump + furnace) can be:
    - Transitional strategy
    - Used for extreme cold only.

### New Construction

- If you’re designing from scratch:
  - Tight envelope + right-sized heat pump:
    - Simplifies mechanical room.
    - Reduces total equipment count.
  - Ductless or mixed ducted/ductless can reduce duct complexity.

---

## Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for future-ready buildings:**
  - **Heat pump as primary heat and cooling**, ideally all-electric.
- **When furnaces still show up:**
  - Legacy systems
  - Fuel economics favor gas in the short term
  - Partial or staged decarbonization strategies.

- **Design guidance:**
  - Start with the envelope.
  - Check local energy prices.
  - Remember: one right-sized heat pump can replace a furnace + AC combo.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you’re installing a new AC anyway, you’re already halfway to a heat pump.*
