## InsightBox — Mineral Wool vs Fiberglass Batts

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **mineral wool insulation** (rock wool / slag wool batts or boards) versus **fiberglass batt insulation**, two common cavity insulation choices in residential and light commercial construction.

Both are non-combustible and widely available, but they differ in **manufacturing energy, durability, moisture behavior, and long-term performance under real jobsite conditions**.

---

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied energy & carbon**

- **Mineral Wool**
  - Made from **basalt rock or recycled steel slag**, melted and spun into fibers.
  - Higher manufacturing temperatures → **higher embodied energy** than fiberglass.
  - Often contains significant recycled industrial waste streams.
- **Fiberglass**
  - Made from sand and recycled glass.
  - Lower melt temperatures than mineral wool → **lower embodied energy per unit**.
  - Still energy-intensive relative to bio-based insulation.

**Transport & installation**

- Both materials ship as compressed batts.
- Mineral wool is **denser and heavier**, increasing transport energy slightly.
- Installation energy is low for both; no curing, chemistry, or special equipment required.

**End of life**

- Both materials are typically landfilled.
- Neither is easily recyclable at demolition scale.
- Mineral wool’s rigidity allows for occasional reuse in selective deconstruction; fiberglass is more prone to tearing and contamination.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **Fiberglass has a modest embodied-energy advantage**, but mineral wool’s durability and performance consistency narrow the gap over the building’s lifespan.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Durability & real-world performance**

- **Mineral Wool**
  - Maintains shape and R-value over time.
  - Resistant to **compression, sagging, pests, and moisture**.
  - Performs reliably even with imperfect installation.
- **Fiberglass**
  - Performance is **highly installation-dependent**.
  - Gaps, compression, and voids can significantly reduce effective R-value.
  - Can lose performance if exposed to moisture or air movement.

**Fire, sound, and resilience**

- Mineral wool is **non-combustible** and often used as a fire-stop.
- Excellent **acoustic absorption**, improving occupant comfort.
- Fiberglass is also non-combustible but offers less fire resistance at assemblies and penetrations.

**Health & indoor air quality**

- Both materials are inert once installed.
- Mineral wool fibers are heavier and less likely to become airborne.
- Fiberglass can irritate skin and lungs during installation, though modern binders have improved.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Mineral wool scores higher** due to durability, moisture tolerance, fire resistance, and consistent long-term performance — all key regenerative traits.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Fiberglass**
  - One of the **lowest-cost insulation options** on the market.
  - Widely stocked and familiar to crews.
- **Mineral Wool**
  - Higher material cost per cavity.
  - Installation cost similar, but material pricing increases total spend.

**Value over time**

- Mineral wool’s resistance to sagging and moisture reduces the risk of future performance loss.
- Fiberglass can deliver good value **only when installed carefully with air-sealing support**.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> **Fiberglass wins on upfront cost**, but **mineral wool delivers stronger cost-per-impact** when durability, fire safety, and performance reliability are valued.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice (budget-driven projects):**
  - Fiberglass batts paired with **excellent air-sealing and quality control**.
- **Performance-forward choice:**
  - Mineral wool for assemblies prioritizing **durability, fire resistance, sound control, and reduced risk**.
- **Design guidance:**
  - If fiberglass is used, treat air-sealing as non-negotiable.
  - Mineral wool is often the safer choice when workmanship varies or long-term resilience matters.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Fiberglass can work when everything is done right. Mineral wool works even when reality gets messy.*
