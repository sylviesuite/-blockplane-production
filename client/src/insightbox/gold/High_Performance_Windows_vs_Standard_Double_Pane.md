## InsightBox — High-Performance Windows vs Standard Double-Pane Windows

### At a glance
This comparison evaluates **high-performance windows** (triple-pane, low-U, advanced
coatings) against **standard double-pane windows**, which remain the most common
baseline in residential construction.

Both meet code in many regions, but they differ meaningfully in **operational energy,
comfort, durability assumptions, and cost per unit of impact**.

---

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)
- **Standard double-pane windows** generally have:
  - Lower upfront embodied energy
  - Mature, high-volume manufacturing
  - Shorter expected service life in demanding climates
- **High-performance windows** carry:
  - Higher embodied energy due to additional glazing layers and coatings
  - More complex manufacturing and transport
  - Longer expected service life and improved thermal stability

Over a full lifecycle, the operational energy savings of high-performance windows
often offset their higher embodied impact, particularly in cold or mixed climates.

---

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)
- **High-performance windows** score higher on RIS when they:
  - Reduce long-term heating and cooling demand
  - Improve occupant comfort and interior surface temperatures
  - Support durable, low-maintenance building envelopes
- **Standard double-pane windows** provide functional performance but:
  - Often require earlier replacement
  - Can contribute to condensation and comfort issues in high-performance walls

RIS reflects not just efficiency, but how well a component supports **long-lived,
low-stress building systems**.

---

### Cost Per Impact (CPI)
- **Standard windows** are typically lower cost and widely available, making them
  attractive for budget-constrained projects.
- **High-performance windows** involve higher upfront cost but improve CPI when:
  - Energy prices are high
  - Heating demand dominates
  - Replacement cycles are extended

In many cases, windows represent a small fraction of total project cost, making CPI
improvements achievable without major budget disruption.

---

### Takeaway
If the goal is basic code compliance at lowest upfront cost, standard double-pane
windows remain a serviceable default.

If the goal is **long-term energy reduction, occupant comfort, and envelope durability**,
high-performance windows deliver outsized benefits relative to their share of total
project cost.

BlockPlane reflects this by rewarding high-performance windows for lifecycle and
regenerative value while remaining transparent about first-cost tradeoffs.

---

### Notes
- Climate zone strongly influences window performance value.
- Frame material and installation quality matter as much as glazing.
- Scores reflect typical North American residential products.
