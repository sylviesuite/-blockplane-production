## InsightBox — Roof–Wall Interfaces: Getting Insulation & Air Right at the Eaves

### At a glance

This InsightBox focuses on the **roof–wall interface at the eaves**, where roofs, walls, insulation, and air barriers collide.

This junction is responsible for a disproportionate share of:
- Ice dams
- Heat loss
- Moisture damage
- Comfort complaints

Most roof failures are not caused by the roofing material or insulation choice alone — they happen because **continuity is broken at the eaves**.

---

## Why the Roof–Wall Interface Is Critical

At the eaves, you must maintain **three continuous control layers**:

1. **Thermal control** (insulation)
2. **Air control** (air barrier)
3. **Water control** (drainage & flashing)

If any one of these breaks at the transition from wall to roof, problems follow — often invisibly.

## Common Roof–Wall Interface Strategies

### 1. Standard Truss with Flat Ceiling (Problem-Prone)

**Typical condition**
- Top plate meets ceiling drywall.
- Insulation depth is pinched at the eaves.
- Vent baffles are compressed or missing.

**Common failures**
- Thin insulation at the perimeter (“cold stripe”).
- Warm ceiling leaks heat to roof deck.
- Ice dams form directly above exterior walls.

**Field reality:**  
Very common, very fragile unless aggressively detailed.

---

### 2. Raised-Heel (Energy) Trusses (Best Practice)

**What changes**
- Truss heel height increased to allow **full-depth insulation** over exterior walls.
- Vent baffles remain open and effective.
- Air barrier continuity is easier to maintain.

**Benefits**
- Uniform insulation thickness.
- Reduced ice dam risk.
- Better blower-door results.

**Field reality:**  
One of the **highest ROI upgrades** in cold and mixed climates.

### 3. Exterior Continuous Insulation Carried to the Roof

**What changes**
- Exterior CI on the wall aligns with:
  - Roof insulation above the deck, or
  - Insulated roof sheathing.
- Thermal bridge at the top plate is reduced or eliminated.

**Benefits**
- Clean thermal continuity.
- Warmer roof deck at critical junctions.
- Lower condensation risk.

**Risks**
- Requires careful detailing at:
  - Fascia
  - Soffits
  - Cladding transitions.

**Field reality:**  
Excellent performance when designed intentionally; sloppy detailing undermines gains.

---

### 4. Unvented Roof Assemblies at the Eaves

**Typical approach**
- Insulation at the roof deck.
- No venting above insulation.
- Ceiling plane may no longer be the primary air barrier.

**Critical requirements**
- Continuous air barrier from wall to roof deck.
- Proper insulation ratios to keep sheathing warm.
- Tight detailing around top plates and rafters.

**Field reality:**  
Works well in experienced hands. High risk if air sealing is treated casually.

---

## Air Barrier Continuity (Non-Negotiable)

At the eaves, the air barrier must transition cleanly:

- From **wall air barrier** (taped sheathing or membrane)
- To **ceiling air barrier** (drywall or membrane), *or*
- To **roof deck air barrier** (unvented assemblies).

**Common failure modes**
- Gaps above top plates.
- Missing sealant at drywall-to-plate joints.
- Penetrations left unsealed in attic edges.

**Rule:**  
If you can’t draw the air barrier as one continuous line at the eaves, it will leak.

---

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

- Poor eave detailing:
  - Increases heating and cooling demand for the life of the building.
  - Drives ice dam repairs and premature roof replacement.
- Good detailing:
  - Reduces energy use every year.
  - Protects insulation performance.
  - Extends roof service life.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Improving the roof–wall interface often delivers **more lifecycle benefit than adding R-value elsewhere**.

---

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

- Continuous insulation and air control:
  - Reduce moisture cycling in framing.
  - Prevent hidden rot and mold.
  - Improve long-term durability.
- Raised-heel trusses and CI:
  - Increase resilience with minimal added material.

**RIS verdict:**  
Assemblies that maintain continuity at the eaves score high on **durability, resilience, and long-term performance**.

---

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- Raised-heel trusses:
  - Small premium over standard trusses.
- Extra detailing at eaves:
  - Minimal labor when planned early.

### Lifetime value

- Fewer ice dam callbacks.
- Lower energy bills.
- Better comfort at exterior rooms.

**CPI verdict:**  
Few details offer **better cost-per-impact** than fixing the roof–wall interface.

---

## Summary Takeaway

- **Best default approach (cold & mixed climates):**
  - Raised-heel trusses
  - Full-depth insulation over exterior walls
  - Clear air barrier continuity at the eaves.
- **For high-performance assemblies:**
  - Align wall CI with roof insulation.
  - Treat the eaves as a first-class design detail.
- **Avoid:**
  - Compressed insulation at exterior walls.
  - Unplanned transitions between wall and roof air barriers.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If the insulation thins at the eaves, the roof will fail there first. Fix the eaves, and half your roof problems disappear.*
