## InsightBox — Interior Air Barrier vs Exterior Air Barrier

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **interior air barrier strategies** versus **exterior air barrier strategies** in wall and roof assemblies.

Both approaches can achieve excellent airtightness. The key differences are in **constructability, durability, sequencing, and long-term reliability**—especially under real jobsite conditions.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Materials & complexity**

- **Interior Air Barrier**
  - Often achieved with airtight drywall, membranes, tapes, and sealants.
  - Lower material quantity, but relies heavily on **multiple sealant interfaces**.
- **Exterior Air Barrier**
  - Typically uses a continuous WRB, sheathing tape, or exterior membrane.
  - Slightly higher material use, but fewer total penetrations.

**Installation energy**

- Both approaches are low-energy in themselves.
- Exterior air barriers often integrate with WRB installation, reducing duplicated effort.
- Interior systems may require multiple passes (pre-drywall, post-mechanical).

**End of life**

- Interior air barriers are often damaged during renovations and hard to re-establish.
- Exterior air barriers are more likely to remain intact through interior remodels.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **Exterior air barriers tend to deliver lower lifecycle risk**, even if material use is slightly higher, due to durability and fewer failure points over time.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Continuity & reliability**

- **Interior Air Barrier**
  - Airtight drywall can perform extremely well when executed perfectly.
  - Vulnerable to:
    - Electrical boxes
    - Plumbing penetrations
    - Future renovations
  - Performance depends heavily on interior sequencing discipline.
- **Exterior Air Barrier**
  - Easier to make **continuous across floors, corners, and transitions**.
  - Penetrations are fewer and more visible.
  - Can be tested and corrected before insulation and finishes.

**Moisture & drying behavior**

- Interior air barriers can allow outward drying if paired with vapor-open exteriors.
- Exterior air barriers paired with vapor-open membranes support **robust outward drying**.
- Exterior placement reduces interior moisture loading into assemblies.

**Adaptability & future-proofing**

- Exterior air barriers protect performance during interior remodels.
- Interior air barriers are frequently compromised during electrical or layout changes.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Exterior air barriers score higher** for resilience, inspectability, and long-term reliability. Interior air barriers work best in tightly controlled builds with minimal future change.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Interior Air Barrier**
  - Lower material cost.
  - Higher coordination cost across trades.
- **Exterior Air Barrier**
  - Slightly higher material cost.
  - Often faster to execute cleanly once crews are trained.

**Value over time**

- Exterior air barriers reduce performance drift over decades.
- Interior air barriers can degrade quietly as buildings evolve.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> **Exterior air barriers often deliver better cost-per-impact**, especially when long-term airtightness and resilience are prioritized.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for durability:**
  - **Exterior air barrier**, continuous and inspectable.
- **When interior air barriers make sense:**
  - Simple geometries, disciplined crews, and minimal future remodeling.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Wherever possible, place the air barrier where it is **continuous, visible, and testable**.
  - Avoid relying on interior finishes as the sole airtightness strategy in complex buildings.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Put the air barrier where you can see it, test it, and keep it intact for decades.*
