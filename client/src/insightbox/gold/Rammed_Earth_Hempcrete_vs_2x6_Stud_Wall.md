## InsightBox — Rammed Earth + Hempcrete vs 2×6 Fiberglass Wall

### At a glance

This comparison looks at a **Rammed Earth + Hempcrete composite wall** (ResiliMass-style assembly with exterior earth, insulated core, and hemp-lime interior) versus a **conventional 2×6 stud wall with fiberglass batts**.

Both can deliver code-compliant thermal performance. The differences show up in **carbon story, mass and comfort, moisture behavior, and long-term durability**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied energy & carbon**

- **Rammed Earth + Hempcrete**
  - Uses **locally sourced soils**, limited cement or lime stabilizer, a rigid insulation core, and a hemp-lime interior wythe.
  - Earth component has **very low embodied energy** when sourced nearby and lightly stabilized.
  - Hempcrete infill adds **biogenic carbon storage**; hemp sequesters CO₂ during growth.
  - Lime and insulation contribute most of the embodied impact, but overall the wall can land in **low to very-low impact territory** when mixes and sourcing are optimized.
- **2×6 Fiberglass Stud Wall**
  - Dimensional lumber, OSB or plywood sheathing, fiberglass batts, and standard cladding.
  - Fiberglass has **moderate embodied energy** and no carbon storage.
  - Lumber stores biogenic carbon but is offset by higher-impact components (OSB, foams, finishes, fasteners).

> **LIS verdict:**  
> With thoughtful mix design and local sourcing, **Rammed Earth + Hempcrete can significantly outperform a standard 2×6 fiberglass wall** on lifecycle impact, especially in carbon terms.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & hygrothermal behavior**

- **Rammed Earth + Hempcrete**
  - Earth and hempcrete are **vapor-open and hygroscopic**: they can absorb, redistribute, and release moisture.
  - When paired with a smart insulation layer and vapor-open finishes, the wall becomes both **structure and moisture buffer**.
  - Small leaks are more likely to be buffered and visible at surfaces instead of hiding in a cavity.
- **2×6 Fiberglass Wall**
  - Fiberglass does not buffer moisture; performance relies on **separate air and vapor control layers**.
  - Air leaks can drive moisture into cold zones, increasing risk of condensation and hidden mold.
  - Cavities can mask problems until damage is advanced.

**Mass, comfort & durability**

- **Rammed Earth + Hempcrete**
  - High **thermal mass** smooths temperature swings and can improve comfort in many climates.
  - Provides **excellent fire resistance** and pest resistance.
  - Durable mineral/plant-based assembly with potential for very long service life when detailed correctly.
- **2×6 Fiberglass Wall**
  - Light, low-mass construction reacts quickly to temperature swings.
  - Fire performance depends heavily on layers and finishes, not the insulation itself.
  - More vulnerable to long-term performance drift if air/vapor control is compromised.

**Repairability & future changes**

- ResiliMass-style walls are **slower to modify** once built, but need fewer interventions if designed well.
- 2×6 walls are easy to cut and patch, but each intervention risks degrading air and vapor control unless carefully repaired.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Rammed Earth + Hempcrete scores higher** on regenerative metrics: moisture buffering, comfort, fire resistance, and long-term durability. The 2×6 wall can work but depends on careful control-layer design and maintenance.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Rammed Earth + Hempcrete**
  - Higher labor cost and specialized forming/placement.
  - Requires trained crews and, in many markets, is treated as a **“custom” assembly**.
- **2×6 Fiberglass Wall**
  - The **commodity baseline**: cheap, fast, and familiar.
  - Widely available trades, standard details, and minimal training burden.

**Value over time**

- Rammed Earth + Hempcrete:
  - Can reduce **maintenance risk** through robustness and moisture buffering.
  - Offers comfort and resilience benefits that show up in occupant experience rather than just energy bills.
- 2×6 fiberglass:
  - Delivers acceptable performance only when **air sealing and vapor control are well executed and preserved** over time.
  - More sensitive to renovation damage, minor leaks, and workmanship variability.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> On first cost, the **2×6 fiberglass wall is cheaper**. On **cost-per-impact over decades**—carbon, durability, comfort, and risk reduction—**Rammed Earth + Hempcrete can be the stronger value** in projects willing to invest upfront.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for regenerative flagship projects:**
  - **Rammed Earth + Hempcrete (ResiliMass-style assemblies)**, especially where local soils and hemp supply are available and the project values long-term resilience.
- **When 2×6 fiberglass walls remain on the table:**
  - Budget-driven work, production housing, or teams not yet ready for alternative wall systems—provided there is **excellent air-sealing and moisture detailing**.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Use ResiliMass-type walls where you want the assembly itself to **carry the load of comfort, moisture management, and carbon performance**.
  - Treat 2×6 fiberglass walls as the **minimum baseline** that must be upgraded with well-designed control layers to move toward truly regenerative performance.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If the project is aiming for legacy, build the mass wall. If you stay with 2×6, treat it as the starting line, not the finish line.*
