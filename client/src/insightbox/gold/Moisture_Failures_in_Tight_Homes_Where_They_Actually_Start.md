## InsightBox — Moisture Failures in Tight Homes: Where They Actually Start

### At a glance

This InsightBox focuses on **where moisture problems in tight, well-insulated homes actually originate** — not on whether tightness is good or bad, but on the failure modes that show up when buildings are built tight without matching control of moisture pathways.

Tight homes reduce uncontrolled air exchange. That can concentrate humidity indoors and shift where condensation or accumulation occurs. The usual failure points are not random: they cluster at transitions, penetrations, and places where air control or drainage was assumed rather than completed.

**Core idea:**  
Moisture failures in tight homes usually start at specific locations and interfaces. Knowing where to look and what to verify reduces surprise and repair cost.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Common starting points**
- **Roof–wall and wall–foundation transitions:** Where planes meet, air barriers and drainage often have gaps or discontinuities. Moisture from condensation or bulk water can accumulate if the detail was not completed or was altered in the field.
- **Penetrations:** Ducts, pipes, wires, and flanges that cross the air or water barrier. Each penetration is a potential pathway. Failures often appear where penetrations were added after the barrier was designed or where sealing was incomplete.
- **Windows and doors:** Head, sill, and jamb details, and the interface between rough opening and unit. Water and air can enter at these joints; failures show up as condensation, staining, or rot when drainage or sealing is insufficient.
- **Ventilation and distribution:** Tight homes depend on intentional ventilation. If supply or exhaust is unbalanced, or if duct runs leak into attics or crawlspaces, moisture can be pulled into cavities or concentrated in living space.

**Why tight homes are sensitive**
- Less dilution from outdoor air means indoor humidity is more influenced by occupancy and mechanical systems. Without adequate ventilation or dehumidification, humidity can rise and condensation can appear at the first cold surface or leak path.
- When failures occur, they are often hidden longer because less air movement means less drying. Problems can grow before they become visible.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Moisture failures in tight homes tend to start at transitions, penetrations, and ventilation or distribution faults. Investing in those details and in verification reduces long-term risk and repair cost.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Durability**
- Catching failure points before they become problems preserves structure and finishes. Once moisture is established, remediation is costly and disruptive.
- Documenting typical failure locations helps future work: retrofits and repairs can target the same interfaces for inspection and upgrade.

**Occupant impact**
- Hidden moisture can affect air quality and health. Identifying and fixing problem areas protects both the building and the people in it.
- Calm, location-based guidance (where things go wrong) supports builder confidence without alarm.

**Unintended consequences**
- Tightening a building without addressing ventilation, drainage, and transitions can create conditions that favor moisture accumulation. The failure is not tightness itself but incomplete control at the places that matter.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Focusing on where moisture failures actually start supports durability and occupant wellbeing. It also clarifies that the fix is better detailing and verification, not less tightness.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Prevention**
- Extra time and material at transitions, penetrations, and critical interfaces are a small fraction of the cost of later discovery and repair. Verification (e.g., visual inspection, checklists) adds modest cost.
- Skipping or shortening these steps saves little upfront and can create large downstream cost when failures appear.

**Repair**
- Fixing moisture damage after the fact is expensive: opening assemblies, replacing materials, and re-establishing barriers. Addressing the same locations during construction is far cheaper.

**Value**
- Spending on the right details and checks delivers high impact per dollar. Spending on generic “more insulation” or “tighter building” without targeting failure points often does not.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Investment in the locations where moisture failures actually start — transitions, penetrations, and ventilation — usually has better cost-per-impact than reactive repair or generic upgrades.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Where failures actually start**
  - Transitions (roof–wall, wall–foundation)
  - Penetrations (ducts, pipes, wires, flanges)
  - Window and door perimeters
  - Ventilation balance and duct placement

- **Why tight homes are sensitive**
  - Less dilution of indoor humidity; more reliance on intentional ventilation and drainage
  - Problems can stay hidden longer and grow before they are noticed

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *In a tight home, moisture problems usually start at a transition, a penetration, or a ventilation mistake. Build and verify those first.*
