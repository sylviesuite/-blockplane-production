## InsightBox — Ventilation Rates & Filtration Strategy

### At a glance

This comparison looks at how mechanical ventilation and filtration are chosen:
- **Rates and strategy defined** (target outdoor air, distribution, and filter level matched to use and risk)
- **Minimum or default only** (code-minimum rate, generic filter, no clear strategy)

Both move air; only one treats ventilation and filtration as a system.

**Core idea:**  
Ventilation rate and filter choice drive indoor air quality, fan energy, and system longevity. Getting the strategy right matters more than the hardware brand.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Minimum or default approach**
- Low first cost; often a single generic filter and code-minimum CFM
- May under-ventilate in tight homes or over-ventilate in leaky ones
- Poor filter choice can increase fan energy and leave particles and allergens in the airstream

**Defined rates and strategy**
- Design specifies outdoor air (e.g., per ASHRAE 62.2 or similar) and filter level (e.g., MERV 13 for particulates)
- Balanced ventilation (HRV/ERV) can recover heat while delivering the rate
- Filter choice trades capture efficiency against pressure drop and fan energy

**System interaction**
- Right rate avoids over- or under-ventilation and supports equipment longevity
- Filtration strategy affects maintenance, IAQ, and resilience (e.g., wildfire smoke, pollen)

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Defining ventilation rate and filtration strategy improves IAQ and system performance over the life of the building; default-only approaches leave both to chance.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Indoor air quality**
- Appropriate outdoor air rate dilutes pollutants and supports health
- Purposeful filtration (e.g., MERV 13+) reduces particles and can help during smoke or allergy seasons

**Comfort and control**
- Strategy can include humidity and distribution (e.g., supply to bedrooms)
- Default setups often ignore distribution and occupant density

**Resilience**
- A clear strategy makes it easier to upgrade filters or adjust for events (smoke, pandemics)
- No strategy means ad-hoc reactions and inconsistent results

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Ventilation rates and filtration strategy support health, comfort, and adaptability; treating them as an afterthought undermines the value of the mechanical system.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Defined strategy: design time, possibly better equipment or filters
- Default: minimal design; whatever is standard on the unit

**Operating cost**
- Higher MERV can increase pressure drop and fan energy; balanced against IAQ gain
- Right ventilation rate avoids over-ventilating (waste) and under-ventilating (risk and callbacks)

**Best-fit cases**
- Defined strategy: high-performance homes, health-sensitive clients, wildfire or allergy regions
- Default: only when scope and budget explicitly exclude ventilation design

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Investing in a ventilation and filtration strategy usually pays back in IAQ, comfort, and fewer callbacks; the cost is small relative to the system’s impact.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Minimum or default**
  - Lowest cost
  - Unclear rate and filter performance
  - Leaves IAQ and resilience to chance

- **Defined rates and strategy**
  - Clear design intent and documentation
  - Better IAQ and ability to adapt
  - Aligns ventilation with building and occupant needs

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Ventilate on purpose. Pick a rate, pick a filter level, and document it. Don’t leave the most important air system to defaults.*
