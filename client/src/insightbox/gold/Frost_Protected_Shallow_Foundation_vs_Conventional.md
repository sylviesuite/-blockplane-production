## InsightBox — Frost-Protected Shallow Foundation vs Conventional Footings

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two approaches to protecting foundations from frost:
- **Conventional deep footings** (below frost line)
- **Frost-Protected Shallow Foundations (FPSF)** using horizontal and vertical insulation

Both can perform well, but they differ significantly in excavation, embodied carbon, and construction efficiency.

**Core idea:**  
FPSFs use insulation and soil heat to prevent frost — not depth alone.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Conventional footings**
- Deep excavation and more concrete
- High embodied carbon from excavation and materials
- Proven and familiar to most crews and inspectors

**FPSF**
- Shallower excavation
- Significantly reduced concrete volume
- Relies on continuous insulation and good detailing

**Thermal behavior**
- FPSFs reduce heat loss at the foundation edge
- Conventional footings often leave slab edges under-insulated

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> FPSFs typically deliver **lower embodied impact** and improved thermal performance when detailed correctly.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Material efficiency**
- FPSFs reduce concrete use — a major carbon win
- Less soil disturbance and trucking

**Durability**
- Properly designed FPSFs perform well in cold climates
- Insulation protects soil from freezing rather than resisting frost mechanically

**System integration**
- FPSFs pair well with slab-on-grade, radiant floors, and high-performance envelopes

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> FPSFs align with regenerative goals by reducing material use while maintaining performance.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- FPSFs often cost less due to reduced excavation and concrete
- Additional insulation and detailing required

**Construction risk**
- FPSFs require understanding and inspection coordination
- Conventional footings are more forgiving of minor errors

**Best-fit cases**
- FPSF: slab-on-grade homes, cold climates, performance-focused builds
- Conventional: complex foundations, inspector resistance, high groundwater

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> FPSFs often deliver **excellent cost-per-impact** when teams are familiar with the approach.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Conventional footings**
  - Familiar and widely accepted
  - Higher material use and embodied carbon
  - Reliable but often overbuilt

- **FPSF**
  - Lower concrete use
  - Better thermal edge control
  - Requires proper design and inspection alignment

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *If you can stop frost with insulation instead of concrete, you usually should.*
