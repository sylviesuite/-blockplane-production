## InsightBox — Commissioning: The Most Underrated Step in Performance Homes

### At a glance

This InsightBox addresses **commissioning as a step that is often skipped or shortened in performance-oriented homes** — and why that step has outsized impact on whether the building actually performs as designed.

Commissioning means verifying that envelope, mechanical systems, and controls are installed and operating as intended. It can include envelope checks (air sealing, insulation continuity), duct testing, equipment start-up and balance, and control verification. In performance homes, the design assumes tight envelope, right-sized equipment, and balanced distribution. If any of those are off, the building underperforms and the investment in "high performance" is partly wasted. Commissioning is where gaps are found and fixed before they become permanent.

**Core idea:**  
Performance depends on what was built and how it runs, not only on what was drawn. Commissioning is the step that closes the loop between design and reality.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**What gets missed without commissioning**
- **Envelope:** Air leakage at transitions, penetrations, or missed details may not be visible after close-in. Blower-door testing and thermography can find gaps that would otherwise drive excess load and comfort issues for the life of the building.
- **Mechanical systems:** Ducts may be leaky or unbalanced. Equipment may be misconfigured or never set to design parameters. Without verification, the system may use more energy and deliver worse comfort than the design assumed.
- **Controls:** Thermostats, setpoints, ventilation schedules, and integration between systems may be at defaults or mis-set. Commissioning confirms that controls match the design intent and that occupants or operators can use them as intended.

**Consequences of skipping or shortening it**
- The building may use more energy than designed, require larger run times or setpoint overrides to achieve comfort, or develop moisture or air-quality issues that could have been caught early.
- Fixing problems after occupancy is more expensive and disruptive than finding and fixing them before handover. Commissioning shifts cost and effort to the right time.

**When commissioning pays off**
- In any building where design assumptions (tightness, balance, control) are critical to performance. The more the design relies on those assumptions, the more valuable verification becomes.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Commissioning verifies that envelope, systems, and controls match the design. Skipping it leaves performance to chance; doing it catches problems when they are cheap to fix and protects the value of the performance investment.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Durability**
- Envelope and mechanical issues caught in commissioning (e.g., duct leakage into attic, missing seal at a penetration) often have durability implications. Fixing them early protects the structure and finishes.
- Documentation from commissioning (test results, setpoints, as-operated conditions) supports future maintenance and troubleshooting.

**Occupant experience**
- A building that performs as designed is more likely to deliver comfort and air quality as intended. That supports satisfaction and reduces callbacks and workarounds.
- When commissioning is framed as "making sure your building works as promised," it builds confidence rather than doubt.

**Unintended consequences**
- Treating commissioning as optional or as a "punch list" item often means it is cut when schedule or budget is tight. The result is that the building is accepted without verification, and problems appear later when they are harder and costlier to fix.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Commissioning supports durability, occupant experience, and long-term performance. It is underrated because its value is in avoiding future cost and failure, which is easy to discount at handover.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Upfront cost**
- Commissioning takes time and may involve third-party testing or review. The cost is a small fraction of the total project and of the cost of fixing problems after the fact.
- Scope can be scaled: at minimum, envelope and duct testing plus equipment and control check; at full scope, ongoing monitoring or recommissioning.

**Value**
- Finding and fixing a single significant leak or one misbalanced system can save more in energy and callbacks than the cost of the commissioning process. In performance homes, the gap between design and as-built is often large enough that commissioning pays for itself many times over.
- The cost of not commissioning is hidden: higher bills, comfort complaints, and remedial work that could have been avoided.

**When to invest**
- In any project where performance claims or targets depend on envelope tightness, system balance, or control strategy. The more that is assumed, the more commissioning is justified.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Commissioning usually has strong cost-per-impact in performance homes. The upfront cost is modest; the cost of skipping it is ongoing underperformance and future repair.

### Summary Takeaway

- **What commissioning does**
  - Verifies envelope (air sealing, continuity)
  - Verifies mechanical systems (ducts, equipment, balance)
  - Verifies controls (setpoints, schedules, integration)
  - Documents as-built and as-operated conditions

- **Why it is underrated**
  - Its benefit is avoiding future cost and failure, which is easy to undervalue at handover
  - It is often cut when schedule or budget is tight, even though that is when it matters most

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Performance homes are only as good as what was built and how it runs. Commissioning is the step that proves it — and the one that pays back when it finds what would have been a lifetime of hidden cost.*
