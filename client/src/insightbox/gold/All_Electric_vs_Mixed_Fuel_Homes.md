## InsightBox — All-Electric vs Mixed-Fuel Homes (Risk & Simplicity View)

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **all-electric homes** (heat pumps, electric water heating, induction or electric cooking) versus **mixed-fuel homes** (natural gas or propane plus electricity).

Both can meet code and feel “normal” to live in. The differences show up in **carbon trajectory, system complexity, resilience, and how future-proof the building really is**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Energy sources & emissions**

- **All-Electric Homes**
  - Use **electricity as the only delivered energy source**.
  - Carbon footprint depends on the **grid mix today** and improves as the grid decarbonizes.
  - Pair naturally with **on-site renewables** (PV) and storage.
- **Mixed-Fuel Homes**
  - Combine electricity with **direct on-site combustion** of gas or propane.
  - Lock in **fossil fuel emissions** for heat, hot water, and sometimes cooking.
  - Even with efficient equipment, total emissions remain tied to fuel use.

**Equipment stack**

- All-electric:
  - Typically built around **heat pumps**, electric or heat pump water heaters, and induction/electric cooking.
  - Fewer combustion systems and flues.
- Mixed-fuel:
  - Furnace or boiler + gas water heater + (sometimes) gas range.
  - More venting, gas piping, and combustion safety requirements.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **All-electric homes have a better emissions trajectory**, especially over the building’s lifespan as grids and on-site renewables improve.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Health & indoor air quality**

- **All-Electric**
  - No on-site combustion → no combustion byproducts indoors.
  - Induction/electric ranges avoid **NOₓ and other pollutants** associated with gas cooking.
- **Mixed-Fuel**
  - Safe when vented and maintained, but add:
    - Combustion appliances and flues.
    - Risk of CO exposure or combustion backdraft in some configurations.
    - Cooking emissions that rely heavily on range hood effectiveness.

**Resilience & future-proofing**

- All-electric:
  - Aligns with **electrification policies**, rebates, and future codes.
  - Compatible with:
    - Solar + battery backup
    - Demand-response programs
  - One energy system to upgrade over time.
- Mixed-fuel:
  - Dependent on both **electric grid and gas/propane infrastructure**.
  - Exposed to fuel price volatility and potential carbon-pricing or policy phase-downs.
  - More complex to fully decarbonize later.

**Complexity & maintenance**

- All-electric:
  - Fewer fuel types, fewer combustion appliances, simpler safety profile.
- Mixed-fuel:
  - More systems to coordinate, vent, and maintain safely.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **All-electric homes score higher** on health, future alignment, and simplicity of long-term decarbonization. Mixed-fuel homes keep more moving parts and fossil dependencies in the system.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **All-Electric**
  - Can be cost-competitive or cheaper in **new construction** when:
    - Gas service, meters, and piping are avoided.
    - One high-efficiency heat pump replaces separate furnace + AC.
  - May require better envelope design to keep heat pump sizes reasonable.
- **Mixed-Fuel**
  - Gas furnaces and water heaters can be cheaper as **drop-in replacements** in existing homes.
  - New builds still pay for gas infrastructure and venting.

**Operating costs**

- All-electric:
  - Heat pump economics depend on **electricity rates, climate, and envelope quality**.
  - Savings grow if:
    - The envelope is efficient.
    - Time-of-use rates or PV offset electricity use.
- Mixed-fuel:
  - Gas can be cost-effective in some regions short-term, but:
    - Vulnerable to long-term **fuel price and policy changes**.
    - Keeps total household emissions higher.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> **All-electric often wins on cost-per-impact** in new builds and deep retrofits when designed intentionally. Mixed-fuel can win on short-term replacement cost, but tends to lose on long-horizon carbon and simplicity.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for new high-performance projects:**
  - **All-electric home**, designed around:
    - A good envelope
    - Right-sized heat pump
    - Electric or heat pump water heating
    - Induction or electric cooking
- **When mixed-fuel remains on the table:**
  - Incremental retrofits where:
    - Budget only covers a like-for-like replacement today, and
    - A phased electrification plan is laid out for the future.
- **Design guidance:**
  - For new construction, treat **all-electric as the baseline**, not the upgrade.
  - If a project must stay mixed-fuel for now, design the **panel, wiring, and mechanical space** so that future electrification is straightforward.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you’re starting from scratch, build for an all-electric future. If you’re stuck with mixed-fuel today, at least design the exits.*
