## InsightBox — Vented vs Unvented Roof Assemblies

### At a glance

This InsightBox compares **vented roof assemblies** (traditional vented attics and vented cathedral ceilings) with **unvented roof assemblies** (insulated at the roof deck, “hot roofs”).

Both can work extremely well, and both can fail badly. The real differences show up in **moisture control, build complexity, and how well they align with modern insulation and air-sealing strategies**.

---

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Vented Roof Assemblies

- Insulation at the **ceiling plane** (flat attic) or between rafters with vent chutes.
- Venting at:
  - Soffits (intake)
  - Ridge or gable vents (exhaust)
- Embodied impact:
  - Typically lower material use at the roof deck
  - Simpler insulation strategies (especially in flat attics).

**LIS snapshot:**  
Lower material intensity and straightforward assemblies can deliver **strong lifecycle performance**, especially in simple, vented attic designs.

---

### Unvented Roof Assemblies (“Hot Roofs”)

- Insulation at the **roof deck** (above, below, or both).
- No intentional venting between insulation and roof sheathing.
- Common approaches:
  - Rigid insulation above the deck
  - Spray foam or dense-pack directly at the deck
  - Hybrid (rigid above + fluffy below).

**LIS snapshot:**  
More material (insulation + sheathing layers) and often higher embodied impact, but can reduce operational energy in complex roofs or compact forms.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Moisture behavior (critical)

- **Vented Roofs**
  - Vent channels help remove:
    - Moisture that sneaks through ceiling plane
    - Solar-driven moisture from shingles.
  - Performance depends on:
    - A tight air barrier at the ceiling
    - Continuous soffit and ridge vents.
  - Flat vented attics are very forgiving when:
    - Ducts stay out of the attic
    - Insulation is continuous.

- **Unvented Roofs**
  - Rely on:
    - Excellent air sealing at the roof deck
    - Proper insulation ratios (rigid vs fluffy) to keep sheathing warm.
  - Can **trap moisture** if:
    - Interior air leaks reach cold sheathing
    - Vapor control is poorly detailed.

**Moisture verdict:**  
Vented attics are **more forgiving** in many climates. Unvented assemblies demand **higher discipline** but can work well when done correctly.

### Complexity & buildability

- **Vented Roofs**
  - Simple on uncomplicated gable roofs.
  - Harder to execute on:
    - Complex rooflines
    - Low slopes
    - Roofs with many penetrations and valleys.

- **Unvented Roofs**
  - Shine in complex forms:
    - Modern rooflines
    - Conditioned attics
    - Cathedral ceilings.
  - Requires careful detailing at:
    - Eaves
    - Transitions
    - Penetrations.

**Buildability verdict:**  
Simple forms favor **vented roofs**. Complex, sculpted roofs often push toward **unvented assemblies**.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Vented Roofs**
  - Lower cost when:
    - Attic is unconditioned
    - Insulation is at the ceiling plane.
  - Costs rise when:
    - Cathedral ceilings require vent baffles
    - Air sealing is difficult at the ceiling.

- **Unvented Roofs**
  - More insulation at the roof deck.
  - Often require:
    - Rigid insulation above the sheathing, or
    - Spray foam at the deck.
  - Higher material and labor cost.

### Operating cost

- **Vented attics**
  - Work best when:
    - Ducts and air handlers are **not** in the attic.
  - If mechanicals are in a vented attic, energy penalties increase.

- **Unvented roofs**
  - Keep mechanicals in conditioned space when:
    - Attic is brought inside the envelope.
  - Reduce thermal losses through ceiling penetrations.

**CPI verdict:**  
Vented roofs usually win on **lowest first cost** and strong CPI in simple houses. Unvented roofs can win CPI in **compact forms with conditioned attics** and integrated mechanicals.

## Design & Climate Notes

### When vented roofs are the better default

- Simple roof shapes (gable, simple hip).
- Space for a full-depth vented attic.
- Mechanical systems can stay out of the attic.
- Cold and mixed climates where:
  - Ceiling air barrier is easy to make tight.
  - Snow and ice dams are managed with insulation + venting.

### When unvented roofs make sense

- Complex rooflines where venting is hard or impossible.
- Houses where:
  - Mechanical systems must live near the roof.
  - The attic is part of the conditioned volume (storage, living space).
- Warm/humid climates where:
  - Exterior rigid insulation above the deck controls condensation.
  - Ducts in a vented attic would be highly penalizing.

## Summary Takeaway

- **Best default for straightforward buildings:**
  - **Vented roof with insulation at the ceiling plane**, keeping:
    - Ducts out of the attic
    - Vent paths clear
    - Air barrier at the ceiling tight.

- **Best choice for complex forms and conditioned attics:**
  - **Unvented roof at the deck**, with:
    - Proper insulation ratios
    - Robust air sealing
    - Thoughtful vapor control.

**Design guidance:**
- Don’t mix vented and unvented approaches in the same roof without a plan.
- Choose a strategy early and design all details (eaves, valleys, penetrations) around it.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Simple house? Vent the attic and keep the ducts out. Complex roof or conditioned attic? Go unvented—but detail it like your building depends on it, because it does.*
