## InsightBox — Heat Pumps vs Furnaces & Boilers

### At a glance

This InsightBox compares **heat pumps** (air-source and ground-source) with traditional **combustion-based heating systems** (gas/oil furnaces and boilers).

All three can deliver a warm building. The big differences show up in **efficiency, carbon intensity, future-proofing, and how they interact with envelopes and distribution systems (radiators, ducts, radiant floors)**.

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Heat Pumps (Air-Source & Ground-Source)

- Move heat rather than creating it by burning fuel.
- **High efficiency**:
  - Air-source: typical seasonal COP ~2–3+
  - Ground-source: COP ~3–4+ with good design
- Carbon impact depends on **grid mix** and electricity source.
- Equipment contains refrigerants with global warming potential; quality installation and maintenance are critical.

**LIS snapshot:**  
When powered by a moderately clean grid (or on-site renewables), heat pumps deliver **much lower lifecycle emissions** than combustion systems.

---

### Furnaces (Forced-Air)

- Burn natural gas, propane, or oil to create heat.
- Efficiency limited by combustion chemistry and flue losses.
- Combustion produces **on-site CO₂ and NOₓ**.
- Distribution via ductwork can add losses and leakage.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Even with high-efficiency furnaces, lifecycle emissions are dominated by **fuel burned every year**.

---

### Boilers (Hydronic)

- Burn fuel to heat water for radiators, baseboards, or radiant floors.
- Can be very efficient at point of combustion.
- Often paired with long-lived distribution systems.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Similar to furnaces: **fuel use drives emissions**, even when the hydronic side is well-designed.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Comfort & control

- **Heat Pumps**
  - Provide **modulated, steady heat** in well-designed systems.
  - Can also provide **cooling**, dehumidification, and shoulder-season comfort.
- **Furnaces**
  - Tend to deliver **hot blasts of air**, with temperature swings between cycles.
- **Boilers**
  - Offer comfortable, even heat through radiant or radiators.
  - Integration with radiant floors is excellent.

### Safety & indoor air

- **Heat Pumps**
  - No on-site combustion → no flue gases or combustion byproducts indoors.
- **Furnaces & Boilers**
  - Require:
    - Proper venting
    - CO monitoring
    - Regular inspection to manage combustion risk.

### Future-proofing

- **Heat Pumps**
  - Align with **electrification and decarbonization** policies.
  - Can benefit as the grid gets cleaner or when paired with **on-site renewables**.
- **Combustion Systems**
  - Lock the building into ongoing fossil fuel use unless extensively retrofitted.

**RIS verdict:**  
Heat pumps score highest on **future compatibility and indoor air quality**. Boilers are strong on comfort where radiant is central. Furnaces are the least aligned with long-term regenerative goals.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Air-Source Heat Pumps**
  - Typically higher upfront cost than a basic furnace, lower than ground-source.
- **Ground-Source Heat Pumps**
  - Highest upfront cost due to drilling or trenching.
- **Furnaces**
  - Lower first cost; often the budget default.
- **Boilers**
  - Moderate to high upfront cost, plus hydronic distribution.

### Operating cost

- **Heat Pumps**
  - Very efficient; can significantly lower operating costs where electricity prices and grid mix cooperate.
- **Furnaces & Boilers**
  - Fuel costs are ongoing and tied to global energy markets.

**CPI verdict:**  
Heat pumps usually win on **cost per unit of delivered comfort over time**, especially in efficient envelopes. Furnaces win on **lowest first cost**, not lifetime value.

## System Integration & Design Notes

### Best matches

- **Heat Pumps**
  - Pair best with:
    - Well-insulated envelopes
    - Reasonable airtightness
    - Thoughtful zoning
  - Can integrate with:
    - Ducted systems
    - Ductless mini-splits
    - Hydronic fan coils (in some designs)
- **Boilers**
  - Pair best with:
    - Radiant floors
    - Radiators
    - Hybrid systems (with buffer tanks)

### Caution points

- Sizing:
  - Oversized furnace or boiler = short cycling and lower efficiency.
  - Undersized heat pump without good design = comfort complaints.
- Retrofit context:
  - Replacing a furnace with a heat pump may require:
    - Duct tweaks
    - Electrical upgrades
    - Envelope improvements for best performance.

---

### Summary Takeaway

- **Best long-term, climate-aligned choice:**
  - **Heat pumps**, especially in buildings with:
    - Decent envelopes
    - Reasonable electric rates
    - Interest in both heating and cooling.
- **Best hydronic comfort in legacy systems:**
  - **Boilers**, particularly when:
    - Radiant floors or radiators are core to the design.
- **Furnaces:**
  - Remain the baseline, low-first-cost option, but:
    - Are the least aligned with low-carbon futures.
    - Often create comfort trade-offs.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you’re building for the next 30 years, start with a heat pump. If you’re stuck in an existing hydronic world, a well-tuned boiler can still serve—but every new combustion system is a bet against where the grid is going.*
