## InsightBox — Heat Pumps: Air-Source vs Ground-Source (Geothermal)

### At a glance

This InsightBox compares **air-source heat pumps (ASHP)** and **ground-source heat pumps (GSHP / geothermal)** across:
- Performance
- Reliability
- Lifecycle impact
- Cost-per-impact (CPI)

Both move heat instead of making it. The difference is **where the heat comes from** — and what that costs you over time.

---

## The Core Difference

### Air-Source Heat Pumps (ASHP)

- Exchange heat with **outdoor air**.
- Performance varies with outdoor temperature.
- Includes:
  - Mini-splits
  - Ducted cold-climate heat pumps

### Ground-Source Heat Pumps (GSHP)

- Exchange heat with the **ground**, which stays relatively stable year-round.
- Use buried loops (horizontal or vertical).
- Higher installation complexity.

---

## Performance Reality (COP & Climate)

### Air-Source

- Modern cold-climate ASHPs perform well down to low temperatures.
- COP drops during extreme cold.
- Still far more efficient than resistance heat or fossil fuels.

**Field reality:**  
In most climates, ASHPs cover **90–100% of heating hours** effectively.

---

### Ground-Source

- Very stable COP year-round.
- Minimal performance drop in cold or hot extremes.
- Peak efficiency advantage in:
  - Very cold climates
  - High heating loads
  - Long run hours

**Field reality:**  
GSHPs shine when run hard, continuously, and for decades.

---

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Air-Source

- Lower embodied impact:
  - No drilling
  - Less material
- Operational emissions depend on:
  - Grid cleanliness
  - Envelope quality

**LIS snapshot:**  
Strong lifecycle performance in most residential buildings.

---

### Ground-Source

- Higher upfront embodied impact:
  - Drilling
  - Piping
  - Concrete
- Long service life can amortize impact over decades.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Best suited to long-life buildings with high annual loads.

---

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Reliability & resilience

- **ASHP**
  - Easier to service or replace.
  - Faster innovation cycle.
- **GSHP**
  - Ground loops can last 50+ years.
  - Mechanical units still age and require replacement.

### Adaptability

- ASHP systems adapt more easily to:
  - Retrofits
  - Future upgrades
- GSHP locks in infrastructure early.

**RIS verdict:**  
ASHPs score higher on flexibility; GSHPs score higher on durability when properly matched.

---

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **ASHP:** Low to moderate
- **GSHP:** High (often 2–4× ASHP installed cost)

### CPI reality

- ASHP CPI improves when:
  - Envelope is strong
  - Loads are modest
  - Budget discipline matters
- GSHP CPI improves when:
  - Heating demand is very high
  - Building lifespan is long
  - Incentives significantly reduce upfront cost

**CPI verdict:**  
For most residential and light commercial projects, **air-source heat pumps deliver better cost-per-impact**.

---

## Integration Matters

Heat pumps perform best when paired with:
- Low-temperature distribution
- Tight envelopes
- Smart zoning
- Thoughtful controls

They perform poorly when:
- Oversized
- Paired with leaky ducts
- Asked to compensate for weak envelopes

---

## Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for most projects:**
  - **Cold-climate air-source heat pumps**
- **Ground-source makes sense when:**
  - Loads are large
  - The building will last generations
  - Budget and site conditions allow
- **Design guidance:**
  - Fix the envelope first.
  - Size the system second.
  - Choose the heat source third.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Spend money reducing the load before spending money chasing efficiency.*
