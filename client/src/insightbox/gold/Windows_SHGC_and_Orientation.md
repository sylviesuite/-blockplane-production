## InsightBox — SHGC & Orientation: Glass That Helps vs Glass That Fights You

### At a glance

This InsightBox explains **Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC)** and how **window orientation** determines whether sunlight:
- Reduces heating demand
- Increases cooling demand
- Or simply causes glare and discomfort

The same window can be **a net benefit or a net penalty** depending on where it faces.

## What SHGC Actually Means

**SHGC** measures:
- How much solar energy passes through a window
- On a scale from 0 to 1

- **Low SHGC (≈0.20–0.30):**
  - Blocks most solar heat
- **Moderate SHGC (≈0.30–0.45):**
  - Balanced gain
- **High SHGC (≈0.45–0.60+):**
  - Admits significant solar heat

**Key point:**  
U-factor controls *loss*. SHGC controls *gain*. You need both.

## Orientation Changes Everything

### South-Facing Windows (Northern Hemisphere)

- Receive:
  - High winter sun
  - Lower summer sun angles
- Easy to control with:
  - Overhangs
  - Awnings
  - Exterior shading

**Best SHGC**
- Moderate to high SHGC
- Allows winter heat gain
- Can reduce heating demand

**Field reality:**  
South-facing glass is often the **most useful glass** on the building.

---

### East- & West-Facing Windows

- Receive:
  - Low-angle morning and afternoon sun
  - Hard-to-shade solar gain
- Major contributors to:
  - Overheating
  - Glare
  - Cooling loads

**Best SHGC**
- Low SHGC
- Smaller window areas
- Vertical shading if possible

**Field reality:**  
Most overheating complaints come from east and west windows.

---

### North-Facing Windows

- Receive:
  - Little direct solar gain
- Mostly a source of:
  - Heat loss
  - Daylight (not heat)

**Best SHGC**
- SHGC matters less
- Focus on:
  - Low U-factor
  - Good frame performance

---

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

- Poor SHGC choices:
  - Increase heating or cooling energy every year.
  - Can negate gains from insulation upgrades.
- Smart SHGC by orientation:
  - Reduces peak loads.
  - Improves real-world energy performance.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Tuning SHGC by orientation often delivers **more lifecycle benefit than upgrading from double to triple pane everywhere**.

---

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Comfort & usability

- Correct SHGC:
  - Reduces overheating.
  - Improves thermal comfort near windows.
  - Minimizes reliance on blinds and shades.
- Incorrect SHGC:
  - Leads to:
    - Blinds closed all day
    - Mechanical cooling workarounds
    - Occupant dissatisfaction.

### Adaptability

- Orientation-based SHGC:
  - Allows buildings to respond naturally to seasonal changes.
  - Reduces dependence on active systems.

**RIS verdict:**  
Windows that work *with* the sun support long-term comfort and resilience.

---

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Where SHGC shines financially

- Adjusting SHGC:
  - Often costs **nothing extra** if chosen early.
  - Delivers ongoing energy and comfort benefits.

- Uniform “one-spec-fits-all” glazing:
  - Simpler to order
  - Worse CPI in most climates.

**CPI verdict:**  
Orientation-specific SHGC is one of the **highest ROI decisions** in window design.

---

## Practical Design Guidance

### Good default strategy (most climates)

- South:
  - Moderate SHGC
- East/West:
  - Low SHGC
- North:
  - Prioritize low U-factor

### When to simplify

- Small window-to-wall ratios
- Tight budgets
- Uniform elevations

Even then:
- Avoid high SHGC on west-facing glass in hot or mixed climates.

---

## Summary Takeaway

- **SHGC is not a “better or worse” number — it’s a directional tool.**
- Let orientation decide:
  - Where solar gain helps
  - Where it hurts
- Combine:
  - Smart SHGC
  - Good installation
  - Thoughtful shading
  for the best real-world performance.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *South-facing glass can heat your house. West-facing glass usually heats your problems.*
