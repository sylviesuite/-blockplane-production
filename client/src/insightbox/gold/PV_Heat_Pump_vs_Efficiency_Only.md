## InsightBox — PV + Heat Pump vs “Efficiency Only”

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two strategies for low-carbon buildings:

1. **PV + Heat Pump Path**  
   - All-electric home with a **high-efficiency heat pump** and **on-site solar (PV)**.

2. **Efficiency-Only Path**  
   - Very high envelope performance (lots of insulation, top-tier windows, airtightness) but **no on-site renewables** and often **fossil backup**.

Both can dramatically reduce energy demand. The differences show up in **carbon trajectory, resilience, cost-per-impact, and where diminishing returns start to appear**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Envelope vs systems vs renewables**

- **Efficiency-Only**
  - Focuses on:
    - Very low U-values (thick insulation)
    - High-performance glazing
    - Extreme airtightness
  - Reduces heating and cooling loads significantly.
  - Still depends on the **energy source feeding the building** (fossil gas, grid electricity mix).
- **PV + Heat Pump**
  - Focuses on:
    - “Good, not extreme” envelope performance.
    - High-efficiency **electric heat pump** for heating and cooling.
    - **On-site PV** to offset a portion of electricity use.
  - Shifts carbon story from just **demand reduction** to **demand reduction + clean supply**.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **Efficiency-first is always step one**, but beyond a certain point, **adding PV and a heat pump often beats pushing the envelope to the extreme** on lifecycle carbon and cost.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Comfort, resilience & future-proofing**

- **Efficiency-Only**
  - Super-insulated buildings can:
    - Ride through outages longer.
    - Maintain comfort with very small mechanical systems.
  - Still tied to the **upstream carbon intensity** of energy used.
- **PV + Heat Pump**
  - Pairs load reduction with:
    - **On-site generation** (PV).
    - **High-efficiency electrified heating/cooling**.
  - Can be combined with **battery storage** or load management for:
    - Outage resilience (limited but meaningful).
    - Participation in future grid programs (demand response, VPPs).

**Scalability & systems impact**

- Efficiency-only:
  - Great at the building level.
  - Impact is limited if **energy still comes from fossil-heavy grids**.
- PV + heat pump:
  - Helps decarbonize at both **building and grid levels** by:
    - Reducing net demand.
    - Shifting heating from fuel combustion to electricity.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **PV + heat pump strategies score higher** on systemic regenerative impact, especially when paired with reasonable (not extreme) envelope performance.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Where money goes**

- **Efficiency-Only Path**
  - Dollars go into:
    - Extra inches of insulation.
    - Triple-pane or better glazing everywhere.
    - Very high levels of airtightness.
  - Each extra increment delivers **smaller marginal gains** once loads are already low.
- **PV + Heat Pump Path**
  - Dollars are split between:
    - Solid but not extreme envelope.
    - High-efficiency heat pump.
    - PV array sized to offset a portion of annual use.
  - Can replace the need for:
    - Separate furnace + AC.
    - Some grid dependence for heating.

**Diminishing returns**

- There is a point where adding **more insulation** or chasing **ultra-low U-values** costs more **per unit of impact** than:
  - Upgrading to a heat pump, or
  - Adding PV to offset remaining loads.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> For many projects, especially new builds, **a balanced approach (good envelope + heat pump + PV) beats an “envelope only” strategy** on cost-per-impact.

---

### Summary Takeaway

- **Step 1 (always):**
  - **Improve the envelope**: reasonable insulation, airtightness, and decent windows.
- **Step 2 (in most modern projects):**
  - **Electrify heating and cooling with a heat pump**.
- **Step 3 (where budget allows):**
  - Add **PV sized to your remaining loads**, rather than pushing the envelope into diminishing-return territory.

**Design guidance:**

- Don’t chase ultra-extreme R-values **before**:
  - Converting heating to a high-efficiency heat pump.
  - Considering PV.
- Use BlockPlane logic to identify the **“elbow point”**:
  - Where each extra inch of insulation costs more (in $ and carbon) than the same money put into a heat pump or PV.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *First, stop wasting energy. Second, heat and cool with an efficient heat pump. Third, make your own clean power — and only then decide if you need that last inch of insulation.*
