## InsightBox — Insulated Slab Edge vs Full Under-Slab Insulation

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two strategies for insulating slab-on-grade foundations:
- **Insulated slab edge only**
- **Full under-slab insulation**

Both reduce heat loss, but they address different pathways and deliver different levels of performance.

**Core idea:**  
Most slab heat loss happens at the edges — but full insulation improves comfort, control, and resilience.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Insulated slab edge**
- Uses less insulation material
- Targets the highest heat-loss zone
- Lower embodied carbon and cost

**Full under-slab insulation**
- Requires more insulation material
- Reduces heat loss across the entire slab
- Improves overall thermal stability

**Performance reality**
- Edge-only insulation captures a large share of potential savings
- Full insulation reduces ground coupling and seasonal heat drain

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Edge insulation delivers the biggest gains per inch; full under-slab insulation delivers the most complete thermal control.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Thermal comfort**
- Full under-slab insulation keeps floors warmer and more stable
- Edge-only insulation can still allow cold floor zones toward the interior in cold climates

**Moisture behavior**
- Insulated slabs stay warmer and drier
- Reduced condensation risk at floor finishes

**System interaction**
- Full insulation improves radiant floor performance
- Reduces heating system cycling and peak demand

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Full under-slab insulation supports comfort, durability, and low-temperature heating systems.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Edge-only insulation is cheaper and simpler
- Full under-slab insulation adds material and labor cost

**Value per performance**
- Edge-only insulation often meets code efficiently
- Full insulation delivers incremental gains that matter in high-performance homes

**Best-fit cases**
- Edge-only: budget-driven or mild climates
- Full under-slab: cold climates, radiant floors, net-zero targets

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Edge insulation offers excellent cost-per-impact; full under-slab insulation pays off when comfort and system efficiency matter.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Insulated slab edge**
  - High return on investment
  - Lower cost and embodied impact
  - Minimum requirement for good slab performance

- **Full under-slab insulation**
  - Better comfort and energy control
  - Supports advanced heating strategies
  - Aligns with high-performance goals

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Insulate the edge no matter what. Insulate the whole slab when you're building for the long term.*
