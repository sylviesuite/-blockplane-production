## InsightBox — ERV vs HRV

### At a glance

Both ERVs and HRVs provide **balanced mechanical ventilation** for airtight buildings.

The difference lies in **what they recover**:
- **HRV (Heat Recovery Ventilator)** recovers heat only
- **ERV (Energy Recovery Ventilator)** recovers heat *and moisture*

**Core idea:**  
The right choice depends less on brand and more on **climate and indoor humidity needs**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**HRVs**
- Simpler construction
- Slightly lower embodied impact
- Excellent heat recovery efficiency

**ERVs**
- Slightly higher embodied impact due to moisture-exchange core
- Reduce latent (humidity-related) loads
- Lower overall HVAC energy use in many climates

**Seasonal performance**
- HRVs excel in cold, dry winters
- ERVs reduce dehumidification demand in humid or mixed climates

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> ERVs often reduce total system energy use where humidity control matters; HRVs shine where dryness is the dominant concern.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Indoor air quality**
- Both systems provide consistent fresh air
- ERVs help maintain healthier indoor humidity levels year-round

**Comfort**
- HRVs can over-dry interiors in cold climates
- ERVs moderate dryness and summer humidity swings

**System integration**
- Both support airtight, low-energy envelopes
- ERVs reduce stress on cooling systems in humid regions

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> ERVs better support comfort and resilience in variable climates; HRVs offer robust simplicity in cold regions.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- HRVs are typically less expensive
- ERVs cost slightly more due to added complexity

**Operating value**
- ERVs reduce heating and cooling system loads tied to humidity
- HRVs deliver strong performance with minimal maintenance

**Best-fit scenarios**
- HRV: cold, dry climates with long heating seasons
- ERV: mixed or humid climates, shoulder seasons, high occupancy

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> The best cost-per-impact comes from matching the ventilator to the climate, not defaulting to one type.

### Summary Takeaway

- **HRV**
  - Best for cold, dry climates
  - Simple, durable, and efficient
  - Excellent for heating-dominated regions

- **ERV**
  - Best for mixed and humid climates
  - Improves comfort by managing moisture
  - Reduces overall HVAC workload

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *If humidity matters, choose an ERV. If dryness is the problem, choose an HRV.*
