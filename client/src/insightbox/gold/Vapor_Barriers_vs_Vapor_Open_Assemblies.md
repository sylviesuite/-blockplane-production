## InsightBox — Vapor Barriers vs Vapor-Open Assemblies

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two fundamentally different moisture-control strategies:
- **Vapor barriers** (tight vapor control)
- **Vapor-open assemblies** (drying potential in one or more directions)

Both can work — and both can fail — depending on climate, materials, and execution.

**Core idea:**  
Vapor control is about **managing moisture safely over time**, not stopping it at all costs.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Vapor barriers**
- Typically low material volume (poly sheets, foil facers)
- High impact if placed incorrectly:
  - Trapped moisture
  - Mold risk
  - Premature material failure

**Vapor-open assemblies**
- Often rely on fibrous insulation, permeable membranes, and hygroscopic materials
- Allow assemblies to dry, reducing long-term risk

**Failure vs durability**
- Vapor barriers tend to be unforgiving
- Vapor-open assemblies tolerate small mistakes better

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Vapor-open assemblies often deliver **lower lifecycle risk**, even if material inputs are slightly higher.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture resilience**
- Vapor-open walls can absorb, redistribute, and release moisture safely
- This supports longer material life and fewer catastrophic failures

**Climate adaptability**
- Vapor-open strategies work well in mixed and cold climates when detailed correctly
- Vapor barriers can perform well in consistently cold climates but require precision

**Material health**
- Vapor-open assemblies pair well with:
  - Cellulose
  - Wood fiberboard
  - Hempcrete
  - Lime plasters

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Assemblies that can **dry** are more resilient, forgiving, and regenerative over decades.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Vapor barriers are cheap in material cost
- Vapor-open systems may cost more upfront due to membranes or specialty materials

**Hidden costs**
- Moisture failures are expensive to diagnose and repair
- Vapor-open assemblies reduce long-term risk and insurance-grade failures

**Value per dollar**
- Vapor-open assemblies often win on avoided risk and durability

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Paying slightly more upfront for drying potential usually saves money long-term.

---

### Summary Takeaway

- **Vapor barriers**:
  - Can work in specific climates and assemblies
  - Require precise detailing and quality control
  - High risk if misapplied

- **Vapor-open assemblies**:
  - Allow drying
  - Tolerate small errors
  - Support long-lived, low-stress buildings

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *If moisture gets in (and it will), make sure it has a safe way out.*
