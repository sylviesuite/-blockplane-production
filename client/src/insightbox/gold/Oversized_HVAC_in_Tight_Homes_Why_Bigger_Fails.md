## InsightBox — Oversized HVAC in Tight Homes: Why "Bigger" Fails

### At a glance

This InsightBox focuses on a specific failure pattern: **oversized heating or cooling equipment in homes that are already tight and well insulated**.

Tight envelopes create small loads. Putting large equipment on small loads leads to short run times, poor humidity control, and equipment that never reaches its efficient operating range. The result is worse comfort and higher operating cost than a right-sized system — and the envelope investment is underused.

**Core idea:**  
In a tight home, "bigger" does not mean "safer." It means the system is wrong for the load.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**What happens in practice**
- Equipment starts, satisfies the thermostat quickly, and shuts off. Run times stay short.
- Short cycles increase on/off wear and reduce seasonal efficiency, because many systems perform best at part load.
- Dehumidification in cooling mode depends on sustained run time; short cycles leave humidity high.

**Envelope–system mismatch**
- The envelope was upgraded to reduce load. Oversizing ignores that reduction and treats the building like a leaky one.
- Larger equipment uses more embodied material and often draws more power at startup than a right-sized unit running steadily.

**Durability**
- Cycling stresses compressors, fans, and heat exchangers. Oversized equipment in tight homes cycles more often than the same equipment in a heavier-load building.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> In tight homes, oversized HVAC increases material use, shortens equipment life, and wastes the benefit of the envelope. Right-sized equipment matches the load and runs in its efficient range.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Comfort**
- Occupants often report uneven temperatures, cold or hot spots, or "the system never runs long enough to dehumidify." That reflects oversizing, not under-sizing.
- Steady, longer run times from right-sized equipment improve temperature stability and humidity control.

**Unintended consequences**
- Contractors or owners may add supplemental heat or cooling (e.g., space heaters, window units) to fix comfort, adding more equipment and complexity.
- Callbacks and distrust of "high-performance" builds can follow when the mechanical system behaves poorly despite a good envelope.

**Risk**
- The real risk in a tight home is moisture and ventilation, not lack of heating or cooling capacity. Oversizing does nothing to address that and can make humidity worse.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Oversized HVAC in tight homes undermines comfort and trust in the envelope. Right-sizing supports comfort, simplicity, and alignment between envelope and mechanicals.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**First cost**
- Oversized equipment often costs more than right-sized. In tight homes, the right size is small.
- Design cost (e.g., load calculation) is low relative to the lifetime cost of the wrong size.

**Operating cost**
- Short cycling and poor part-load performance increase energy use over the season.
- Humidity complaints can lead to lower thermostat setpoints in summer or higher in winter, further increasing demand.

**CPI**
- Money spent on larger equipment and higher operating cost delivers no benefit in a tight home. Investment in load calculation and right-sized equipment delivers better comfort and lower cost per outcome.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> In tight homes, oversizing is poor cost-per-impact. Right-sized equipment and a load-based design usually cost less upfront and over time.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Oversized HVAC in tight homes**
  - Short cycles, poor dehumidification, uneven comfort
  - Wastes envelope gains and increases equipment wear
  - Often chosen from habit, not from load

- **Right-sized HVAC in tight homes**
  - Longer run times, better humidity control, steadier comfort
  - Matches the envelope and uses equipment as intended
  - Requires a load calculation; avoids the "bigger is safer" trap

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Tight house, small load. Size the equipment to the load, not to the square footage or the old unit.*
