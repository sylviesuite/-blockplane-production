# Gold InsightBox — Mineral Wool vs Fiberglass Batts

## Summary Takeaway

Both mineral wool and fiberglass batts keep embodied energy well below foam alternatives, yet their day-to-day behavior diverges once you rely on real crews and variable construction sequences. Fiberglass batts win on cost and initial LIS when installed with precision and air control, but they are fragile—compression, gaps, or air leaks quickly erode the theoretical low-impact score. Mineral wool carries a modestly higher upfront impact and material cost, yet it consistently delivers stable thermal performance, superior fire resilience, and better moisture tolerance, making it the safer choice when durability and long-term predictability are mission-critical.

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS perspective)

### Embodied Energy & Carbon
- Reference values for fiberglass batts: density ~20 kg/m³ (range ~12–30), thermal conductivity ~0.04 W/m·K (~0.03–0.05), R-value ~3 per inch (~2.5–3.5 per inch), embodied energy ~20 MJ per functional unit (functional unit as defined in source). Fiberglass batts are spun from recycled glass cullet at lower temperatures and packaged in compact bales; when transportation is within a typical range, LIS and carbon sit in a moderate band—exact values depend on the defined functional unit and manufacturer EPDs.
- Mineral wool requires higher-temperature melting (around 1,400 °C) and binding with phenol/formaldehyde resins, so LIS typically sits ~5–8 points higher for the same R-value. If sourced from EU/US manufacturers that use renewable electricity in the melt loop, that penalty shrinks, but it never quite reaches fiberglass’s baseline.

### Longevity & Replacement Risk
- Fiberglass loses thermal performance rapidly if compressed, cut poorly, or exposed to convective air paths. The resulting voids can add 5–10 % to heating loads in cold climates and raise LIS effectively over time because of performance loss and potential rework.
- Mineral wool keeps loft, density, and R-value even when it contacts minor moisture or is lightly compressed during drywall installation. That stability means lifecycle carbon stays close to the installed value, not “inflated” by on-site mistakes, so the real-world LIS often closes or even reverses the gap after a few years of occupancy.

### Net Effect

In tightly controlled, verified installations, fiberglass can outperform mineral wool on paper. In most real-world construction (rotating crews, tight schedules, retrofit envelopes), mineral wool’s lower sensitivity to installation variance usually yields a more consistent LIS over the building lifespan.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS perspective)

### Fire & Health
- Mineral wool is non-combustible and can contribute positively to the RIS score when fire resilience is weighted. It can hold back heat in assemblies exposed to wildfire or flashover risk.
- Fiberglass also resists fire, but the facings, adhesives, or binder chemistries differ between manufacturers; some rely on halogenated flame retardants that slightly drag down RIS when health impact weightings are strict.

### Moisture & Mold
- Mineral wool is hydrophobic yet vapor permeable, so it sheds incidental moisture and slows mold growth; that reduces long-term risks that would otherwise factor into RIS.
- Fiberglass can trap moisture if paired with poor air sealing or vapor barriers, creating mold conduits that deteriorate IAQ and potentially require insulation replacement—this risk lowers the RIS score unless you can prove airtightness.

### Circularity

Both materials still face limited recycling infrastructure in North America, but mineral wool’s durability increases the probability it stays in service for the building’s full lifespan, preserving embodied effects and keeping RIS from being dragged down by early replacements.

## Cost & Constructability

### Material Cost
- Fiberglass batts are typically 30–50 % cheaper per square foot than mineral wool, especially for high-R-value kits.
- Mineral wool carries a premium, and thicker assemblies (R-30+) compound the price difference, though that gap tightens when factoring in reduced rework risk and faster quality verification.

### Installation Quality
- Fiberglass demands full cavity fill, careful cutting around framing, and tight air sealing to realize its rated R-value; any gaps or compression create thermal bridges that inflate the LIS over time.
- Mineral wool is stiffer, easier to friction-fit, and more forgiving of minor mistakes, so crews with varying skill levels can still achieve near-rated performance.

### Labor Sensitivity
- Fiberglass is more sensitive to rushed installs—tape measures are optional, but precision is not. It’s a good match when construction quality is strictly controlled or in environments where inspections are frequent.
- Mineral wool reduces performance variability, which is why it often becomes the preferred choice for owner-occupied projects, high-end retrofits, and markets with less experienced framing crews.

## Decision Guidance

- **Choose fiberglass batts when**:
  * Budget constraints dominate and you need the lowest upfront cost.
  * Air sealing and installation quality can be enforced (third-party verification, blower door testing, experienced crews).
  * Fire and moisture risks are low, and the assembly sits within a performance-verified air barrier.
  * You can commit to post-installation test/verification to catch any compressions or gaps.

- **Choose mineral wool when**:
  * Fire resilience is a priority (wildfire edge, multi-family hallway, or egress assemblies).
  * Moisture robustness matters (humid climates or retrofit envelopes with unknown condensation paths).
  * Long-term performance predictability outranks upfront cost.
  * Construction quality may vary between trades or sites.

## BlockPlane Bottom Line

This pairing shows that the lowest embodied impact in documentation does not always equal the lowest real-world impact. Mineral wool often earns higher RIS points because it limits risk, whereas fiberglass shines on LIS only when crews execute near-perfect installations. We treat this as a contextual decision, not an absolute verdict—point to this gold standard when you need to explain why predictability vs. fragility is the real tradeoff.

## Notes & Uncertainty

- Embodied energy values fluctuate by manufacturer and regional power grid mix; check current EPDs when you quantify LIS for a specific project.
- Fire performance advantages may carry additional weight in wildfire-prone regions, which further tilts RIS in mineral wool’s favor.
- Actual impact depends heavily on the surrounding air barrier and detailing; an air-leaky assembly with mineral wool still outperforms compressed fiberglass in most climates because of lower long-term degradation.
