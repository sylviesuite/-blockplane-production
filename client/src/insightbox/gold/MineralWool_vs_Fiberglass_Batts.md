## InsightBox — Mineral Wool vs Fiberglass Batts

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two common cavity options for walls and roofs:
- **Mineral wool batts** — stone/slag fiber, higher density, non-combustible, friction-fit
- **Fiberglass batts** — glass fiber, lower density, friction-fit; default in many code-minimum homes

Both keep embodied energy below foam alternatives. They differ on **fire resistance, moisture behavior, install reliability, and cost**.

**Core idea:**  
Mineral wool carries higher upfront embodied impact and material cost but holds R-value under real-world conditions; fiberglass wins on first cost when install quality is high and air control is enforced.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied impact**
- Fiberglass batts: recycled glass cullet, lower melt temperatures, compact bales; embodied energy and carbon per R sit in a **moderate band** (values depend on functional unit and manufacturer EPDs).
- Mineral wool: higher-temperature melt (around 1,400 °C), binders; LIS typically **~5–8 points higher** for the same R-value. Renewable electricity in the melt loop can shrink the gap but rarely matches fiberglass baseline.

**Operational performance**
- Fiberglass loses thermal performance with **compression, poor cutting, or convective air paths**; voids can add 5–10 % to heating loads in cold climates and raise effective LIS over time.
- Mineral wool **keeps loft and R-value** with minor moisture or light compression during install; real-world LIS often closes or reverses the gap over the building lifespan when install variance is high.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> In controlled, verified installations fiberglass can win on paper. In most real-world construction, mineral wool’s lower sensitivity to install variance usually yields **more consistent lifecycle impact** over the building’s life.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & mold**
- Mineral wool is **hydrophobic and vapor permeable**; sheds incidental moisture and slows mold growth, which supports long-term durability and RIS.
- Fiberglass can trap moisture with poor air sealing or vapor barriers, creating mold risk and potential replacement—lowers RIS unless airtightness is proven.

**Fire resistance**
- Mineral wool is **non-combustible** and can contribute to fire resilience (wildfire edge, multi-family, egress assemblies).
- Fiberglass resists fire, but facings and binder chemistries vary; some use halogenated flame retardants that can weigh on health/RIS when strict.

**Density & install reliability**
- Mineral wool is **stiffer and easier to friction-fit**; more forgiving of minor mistakes, so varying crew skill still achieves near-rated performance.
- Fiberglass demands full cavity fill, careful cutting, and tight air sealing; gaps or compression create thermal bridges and inflate LIS over time.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Mineral wool often scores better on **moisture tolerance, fire resilience, and install reliability**; fiberglass depends on near-perfect install and air control.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Fiberglass batts: typically **30–50 % cheaper per square foot** than mineral wool, especially for high-R kits.
- Mineral wool carries a **premium**; thicker assemblies (R-30+) compound the difference, though reduced rework risk can narrow the gap.

**Return on investment**
- Mineral wool’s premium often **pays off** where fire resilience matters, moisture robustness is valued, or construction quality varies between trades or sites.
- Fiberglass wins on **strict budget** when air sealing and install quality can be enforced (verification, blower door, experienced crews).

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Batts win on **upfront cost**; mineral wool often pays off where **durability, fire resistance, and install tolerance** are priorities.

### Performance notes

- Embodied values vary by manufacturer and regional grid; check current EPDs for project-specific LIS. Fire and moisture advantages weigh more in wildfire-prone or humid regions. Both depend on the surrounding air barrier and detailing.

### Installation & risk

- Fiberglass is sensitive to rushed installs—precision matters. Full cavity fill, careful cutting, and air sealing required; compression and gaps erode performance. Mineral wool is more forgiving but still needs correct fit and sequencing; dry cavities for both.

---

### Summary Takeaway

- **Mineral wool**:
  - Preferred when **fire resilience**, moisture robustness, or long-term performance predictability matters
  - Higher upfront embodied impact and cost; more consistent real-world R-value when install quality varies

- **Fiberglass batts**:
  - Choose when **budget dominates** and air sealing plus install quality can be enforced
  - Lowest upfront cost; fragile to compression, gaps, and air leaks—LIS holds only with near-perfect install

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Mineral wool buys predictability; batts need near-perfect install to hold their impact.*
