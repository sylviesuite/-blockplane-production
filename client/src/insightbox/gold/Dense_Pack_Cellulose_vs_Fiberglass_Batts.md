## InsightBox — Dense-Pack Cellulose vs Fiberglass Batts

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two common options for wood-framed walls and roofs:
- **Dense-pack cellulose** — recycled paper fiber, blown at high density into cavities (often with netting)
- **Fiberglass batts** — glass fiber, friction-fit in stud bays; default in many code-minimum homes

Both are familiar to builders. They differ on **moisture, air control, embodied impact, and cost**.

**Core idea:**  
Cellulose adds air resistance and moisture buffering; batts insulate only and are vulnerable to gaps and convection. For the same R, cellulose usually wins on carbon and real-world performance; batts often win on first cost.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied impact**
- Dense-pack cellulose: mostly **recycled newsprint**, low-temperature process; embodied energy and CO₂ per R are **low to moderate**; **biogenic carbon** stored in the wall for service life.
- Fiberglass batts: sand and recycled glass melted at high temperature; embodied energy and CO₂ per R are **moderate to high**, especially where grid is fossil-heavy.

**Operational performance**
- Cellulose ships as dense bales and expands on site (efficient per R); when dense-packed correctly it resists settling and **holds performance for decades**. Batts are bulky in transit and in the wall more vulnerable to **compression, gaps, and convection loops**, which erode real-world R over time.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> For the same R-value, dense-pack cellulose typically delivers **lower embodied carbon** and **more reliable in-place performance** than fiberglass batts.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & durability**
- Cellulose: **hygroscopic** — can buffer small moisture events and redistribute safely in vapor-open assemblies; supports durability when detailed correctly.
- Batts: almost no moisture buffering; condensation can sit against cold surfaces where air control is poor.

**Air control**
- Dense-pack at high density **reduces cavity air movement** and convective looping; more forgiving of minor detailing.
- Batts are air-permeable; performance depends on **perfect fit and separate air-sealing**. Gaps and compression undermine R-value.

**Health & install**
- Cellulose uses borate treatment (fire, pest); low-toxicity when installed correctly; installers should wear PPE. Batts can shed **respirable fibers** during install or when exposed — a concern in leaky or unfinished assemblies.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Cellulose supports **moisture buffering, air control in the cavity, and durability** better than fiberglass batts in vapor-open, well-detailed assemblies.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Fiberglass batts: usually **lowest material cost**; every crew knows them.
- Dense-pack cellulose: **higher installed cost** (specialized equipment, trained crews) but better real-world performance per inch when done right.

**Return on investment**
- For **code-minimum, budget-only** jobs, batts are often chosen.
- For **comfort, quiet, and lower embodied carbon**, cellulose often delivers **better cost-per-impact** when paired with airtight detailing.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Batts often win on **upfront cost**; cellulose tends to win on **cost per performance** where clients care about comfort, durability, and carbon.

### Performance notes

- Cellulose performance depends on **installed density** (target specs); batts depend on fit and lack of compression or gaps. Neither replaces a continuous air barrier when the assembly needs one.

### Installation & risk

- Dense-pack needs the right equipment and technique to avoid overpacking (framing stress) or underpacking (settling). Batts need careful cutting and placement to avoid gaps and compression. Both require dry cavities and correct sequencing.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Dense-pack cellulose**:
  - Better default for high-performance walls and roofs when equipment is on site
  - Lower embodied carbon, biogenic storage, stronger real-world R with good air control

- **Fiberglass batts**:
  - Low-cost option for **code-minimum, budget-only** jobs
  - Rarely win when the client cares about comfort, durability, and carbon; reserve for cost-constrained scenarios

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Cellulose works with the wall. Batts depend on perfect fit and everything else being done right.*
