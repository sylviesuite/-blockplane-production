## InsightBox — Dense-Pack Cellulose vs Fiberglass Batts

### At a glance
Dense-pack cellulose and fiberglass batts can deliver comparable R-values on paper, but they trade off differently when the envelope is built. Dense-pack cellulose combines dense, recycled fibers with pressure installation so it resists air movement and buffers moisture, while fiberglass batts stay light, flexible, and affordable but rely entirely on installation discipline for performance. This comparison highlights how the two strategies diverge on carbon, moisture, and reliability so builders can match the assembly to the project’s tolerance for risk.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)
- **Embodied energy & recycled content** – Cellulose typically has lower embodied energy because it is made from recycled paper fiber; the production process consumes less heat than melting glass. Fiberglass batts require a high-energy glass-melting furnace, which raises the initial LIS even if some recycled glass is used.
- **Manufacturing intensity** – Both products ship regionally, but cellulose production includes fewer high-temperature steps, which keeps the carbon profile lower. Fiberglass batts are produced in continuous furnaces that demand steady energy input, and quality changes when fiber density shifts.
- **Installation gaps & losses** – Dense-pack cellulose is blown under pressure to minimize settling, so it retains density and performance over time. Fiberglass batts are typically friction-fit, and voids, compression, or wind washing during construction immediately degrade effective R-values.
- **Service life** – When installed correctly, both systems can last the life of the building, but cellulose’s resistance to settling and pest damage tends to keep R-values more stable. Batts can sag or compress if not supported, which accelerates performance loss later.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)
- **Carbon storage potential** – Cellulose stores carbon in the recycled fibers and can be sourced with very low-impact binders, improving its RIS profile. Fiberglass batts don’t store carbon and contribute to higher embodied emissions upfront.
- **Moisture behavior** – Cellulose’s hygroscopic nature helps buffer incidental moisture, reducing the risk of condensation by releasing dampness back into the cavity. Fiberglass is hydrophobic and simply lets moisture pass, which can stress air barriers if vapor control is not tightly managed.
- **Air sealing effectiveness** – Dense-pack minerals slam up against framing to slow convective loops, while fiberglass batts leave gaps unless complemented by a dedicated air barrier. The difference shows up in blower-door tests and occupant comfort.
- **Durability & end-of-life** – Cellulose ages with minimal settling, but the fiber mass can settle if not densely packed or if moisture enters over time. Fiberglass batts can be removed and recycled, but they may also break down into loose fibers that pose handling challenges during retrofits.

### Cost Per Impact (CPI)
- **Material cost** – Fiberglass batts remain less expensive per bag, but cellulose can be cost-competitive when reclaimed fiber sources are nearby. The premium shows up in dense-pack equipment and trained crews.
- **Labor intensity** – Dense-pack installs require blowers, trained installers, and QA to verify density, which increases labor cost. Batts install quickly with standard framing crews, but achieving air-tight performance usually needs additional sealing efforts.
- **Performance reliability** – Cellulose delivers consistent real-world R-values if the dense-pack target is met, so its CPI improves over time. Batts frequently underperform in the field because small gaps translate to significant energy loss, hurting long-term cost per energy saved.
- **Long-term energy outcomes** – The air-blocking nature of cellulose limits convective heat transfer, which lowers operational energy use in both cold and mixed climates. Fiberglass batts can reach parity only if paired with careful air sealing and better-quality installation.

### Summary takeaway
Prefer dense-pack cellulose when the job demands reliable field performance, stronger moisture buffering, and a lower embodied carbon profile—especially in retrofit work or high-performance homes where air sealing is critical. Stick with fiberglass batts when budgets are constrained, crews already master batt installation, and supplemental air barrier strategies are enforced, recognizing that this path shifts more risk to installation quality. Either strategy can work when teams understand the RIS/LIS trade-offs and validate airtightness and density after installation.
