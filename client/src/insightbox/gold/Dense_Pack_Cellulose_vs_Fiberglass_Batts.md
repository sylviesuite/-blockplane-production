## InsightBox — Dense-Pack Cellulose vs Fiberglass Batts

### At a glance
This comparison looks at **dense-pack cellulose insulation** versus **fiberglass batt insulation** in wood-framed wall and roof assemblies. Both are familiar to builders, but they behave very differently on moisture, air control, and carbon.

**Where they show up**
- Dense-pack cellulose: retrofits and high-performance walls, often blown into cavities with netting.
- Fiberglass batts: the default in many code-minimum homes, friction-fit in stud bays.

**Quick read**
- Cellulose usually wins on **carbon and air control**.
- Fiberglass often wins on **lowest first cost**, but not on performance-per-dollar.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied energy & carbon**
- **Cellulose** is mostly recycled newsprint with a low-temperature manufacturing process. Embodied energy and CO₂ per R-value are **low to moderate**, and a portion of the carbon is **biogenic and stored** in the fibers during service life.
- **Fiberglass batts** require melting sand and recycled glass at high temperatures. Embodied energy and CO₂ per R-value are **moderate to high**, especially in regions with fossil-heavy grids.

**Transport & packaging**
- Both are relatively light, but **cellulose travels as dense bales** and expands on site; this is efficient per R-value shipped.
- Batts are bulky and compress only slightly in transit; more truck volume per unit R.

**Service life & durability**
- When detailed correctly, dense-pack cellulose can **maintain performance for decades**, resisting settling in closed cavities.
- Fiberglass batts are more vulnerable to **compression, gaps, and convection loops**, which quietly erode real-world R-value over time.

**LIS takeaway**
> For the same R-value, dense-pack cellulose typically delivers **lower embodied carbon** and **more reliable in-place performance** than fiberglass batts, especially in climate zones with significant heating loads.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Carbon storage**
- Cellulose stores biogenic carbon in the wall for the life of the building. If kept dry and reused or downcycled at end of life, this is a **net positive** compared to mineral fibers.
- Fiberglass provides no meaningful carbon storage; its value is only in operational energy savings.

**Health & IAQ**
- Modern cellulose uses borate treatments for fire and pest resistance; these are generally considered low-toxicity when installed correctly, but installers should still wear PPE.
- Fiberglass batts can shed **respirable fibers** during installation and if left exposed; this is a worker-safety and IAQ concern in leaky assemblies or unfinished spaces.

**Moisture & resilience**
- Dense-pack cellulose, in a ventilated and well-detailed assembly, can **buffer small moisture events** and redistribute moisture safely, especially with vapor-open sheathing and smart membranes.
- Fiberglass batts have almost no moisture-buffering capacity and can hold condensation against cold surfaces, creating risk where air control is poor.

**RIS takeaway**
> In resilient, vapor-open assemblies, cellulose supports **carbon storage, moisture buffering, and worker health** better than standard fiberglass batts.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Material & labor**
- Fiberglass batts usually win on **lowest material cost** and are familiar to every crew.
- Dense-pack cellulose often has **higher installed cost per square foot** because it requires specialized equipment and trained crews, but it also delivers **better real-world performance per inch** when installed correctly.

**Cost-per-impact guidance**
- For **budget-only projects** chasing code minimum, fiberglass batts may still be chosen.
- For **clients pursuing comfort, quiet, and lower embodied carbon**, cellulose frequently offers **better value per unit of lifecycle impact**—especially when paired with air-tight detailing that the crew is already on site to do.

### Summary Takeaway for Builders

If you’re already setting up dense-pack equipment on site, cellulose is usually the **better default** for walls and roofs:

- Lower embodied carbon than fiberglass batts  
- Biogenic carbon storage in the assembly  
- Stronger real-world R-value when combined with good air control  
- Better alignment with high-performance and regenerative building goals  

Fiberglass batts remain a **low-cost, commodity option**, but they rarely win when the client cares about comfort, durability, and carbon. When in doubt, treat **dense-pack cellulose as your “good, better, best” baseline**, and reserve batts for only the most cost-constrained scenarios.
