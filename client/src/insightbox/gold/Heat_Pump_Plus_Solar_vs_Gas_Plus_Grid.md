## InsightBox — Heat Pump + Solar vs Gas + Grid

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two whole-house energy strategies:
- **Heat pump + on-site solar** (electric space and water heating with PV)
- **Gas heating + grid electricity** (combustion for heat, grid for everything else)

Both can power a comfortable home. The difference is where the energy comes from and how it evolves over time.

**Core idea:**  
Heat pump + solar shifts heating to electricity and pairs it with on-site generation. Gas + grid keeps combustion on-site and ties the building to fossil infrastructure.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Gas + grid**
- Lower upfront cost for heating equipment
- Ongoing combustion emissions and grid emissions for plug loads and cooling
- No path to reduce heating emissions without changing the heat source

**Heat pump + solar**
- Higher upfront: heat pump(s), possible panel upgrade, PV system
- Heating and cooling run on electricity; solar offsets a share of total use
- As the grid cleans up, heat pump emissions fall even without more solar

**System interaction**
- Heat pumps pair well with good envelopes; smaller systems and less PV needed
- Gas heating does not benefit from PV; solar only offsets non-heating loads unless the house is all-electric

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Heat pump + solar typically delivers lower lifecycle emissions and aligns with a decarbonizing grid; gas + grid locks in combustion unless the heat source is later replaced.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Resilience**
- Solar + battery can keep critical loads (and sometimes heat) running during outages
- Gas depends on pipeline and ignition; heat pumps need electricity

**Future-proofing**
- Heat pump + solar positions the building for electrification and future codes
- Gas + grid keeps the building on a fuel that many jurisdictions are phasing down

**Occupant agency**
- On-site solar gives some control over source and cost
- Gas + grid leaves heating fully exposed to utility and commodity prices

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Heat pump + solar supports resilience, decarbonization, and alignment with policy; gas + grid is simpler today but carries transition risk.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Heat pump + solar: higher (equipment + PV + possible electrical upgrades)
- Gas + grid: lower for heating; solar can be added later for other loads

**Operating cost**
- Heat pump + solar: depends on PV size, rates, and incentives; can beat gas over time
- Gas + grid: predictable until gas and carbon policy change

**CPI**
- Where incentives and rates favor electrification and solar, heat pump + solar can deliver strong carbon reduction per dollar over the life of the building

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Heat pump + solar usually wins on cost-per-impact when the building is efficient, incentives exist, and the owner has a long time horizon.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Gas + grid**
  - Lower first cost for heating
  - Locks in combustion and grid dependence for other loads
  - Sensible for short horizons or where electrification is not yet feasible

- **Heat pump + solar**
  - Higher first cost
  - Lower operating emissions and path to further decarbonization
  - Best when the envelope is solid and the client is planning long-term

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Tight envelope first. Then heat pump. Then solar. Gas + grid is the default to move away from, not toward.*
