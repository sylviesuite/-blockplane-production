## InsightBox — Mechanical Dehumidification: When It's Necessary (and When It's Not)

### At a glance

This InsightBox addresses **when to add dedicated mechanical dehumidification** versus when envelope, ventilation, and cooling system choices can manage humidity without it.

Humidity affects comfort, health, and durability. In some climates and building types, mechanical dehumidification is essential. In others, airtightness, ventilation strategy, and cooling equipment run time can be enough. Adding dehumidification when it is not needed adds cost, complexity, and energy use; skipping it when it is needed leads to moisture problems and callbacks.

**Core idea:**  
Dehumidify when the building and climate demand it. Do not assume every high-performance home needs a dedicated dehumidifier, and do not assume that none do.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**When it's necessary**
- Humid climates, especially where cooling load is low (e.g., mild shoulder seasons, efficient envelopes): the cooling system may not run long enough to remove moisture. Latent load stays high while sensible load drops. Dedicated dehumidification can be required to avoid elevated indoor humidity.
- Basements, crawlspaces, or other zones with high moisture load or limited conditioning: mechanical dehumidification is often the only practical way to keep conditions safe and durable.
- Tight buildings with high occupancy or moisture sources (e.g., many occupants, drying laundry, aquariums): ventilation may not be enough to control humidity; supplemental dehumidification can be necessary.

**When it's not**
- In dry or cold climates, or in buildings where cooling runs long enough to manage latent load, a separate dehumidifier can add energy and maintenance without clear benefit.
- Where the main problem is air leakage bringing in humid air, sealing and ventilation strategy can reduce humidity more effectively and at lower lifecycle cost than adding dehumidification on top of a leaky envelope.

**Envelope interaction**
- Airtightness and controlled ventilation reduce unintended moisture entry. When those are in place, the need for mechanical dehumidification depends on climate, use, and cooling equipment behavior. When they are not, dehumidification can be treating a symptom of poor envelope or ventilation.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Mechanical dehumidification is necessary where latent load is high and cooling or ventilation cannot handle it. It is unnecessary or secondary where envelope and ventilation are the main levers.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Durability**
- Persistent high humidity risks mold, corrosion, and condensation in cavities. In buildings or zones where that risk is real, dehumidification protects the structure and finishes.
- In buildings where humidity is already controlled by other means, adding dehumidification adds equipment and energy without clear durability gain.

**Comfort and health**
- Occupants feel humidity. When it is chronically high, comfort and perceived air quality suffer. Mechanical dehumidification can resolve that when envelope and ventilation are not enough.
- Over-drying is possible with aggressive dehumidification; it can cause discomfort and material stress. Sizing and setpoints matter.

**Unintended consequences**
- Installing dehumidification instead of fixing air leakage or ventilation can mask envelope problems and increase long-term energy use.
- Skipping dehumidification in humid, low-load or high-moisture-load situations can lead to callbacks, health concerns, and damage.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Use mechanical dehumidification where the building and climate require it. Avoid using it as a substitute for envelope and ventilation, and avoid omitting it where latent load cannot be managed otherwise.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**When it's necessary**
- First cost: equipment, duct or placement, controls, condensate disposal. Operating cost: energy and maintenance. The cost is justified when humidity would otherwise be high and cause comfort, health, or durability issues.

**When it's not**
- The same first and operating costs deliver little benefit if envelope, ventilation, or cooling already control humidity. Budget is better spent on sealing, ventilation design, or right-sized cooling.

**Decision**
- Assess climate, building tightness, ventilation rate, cooling run time, and moisture sources. Where latent load consistently exceeds what cooling and ventilation can handle, add mechanical dehumidification. Where it does not, invest in envelope and ventilation first.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Mechanical dehumidification has good cost-per-impact when it addresses a real humidity problem. It has poor cost-per-impact when used as a default or as a substitute for envelope and ventilation fixes.

### Summary Takeaway

- **When mechanical dehumidification is necessary**
  - Humid climates with low or short cooling run times
  - Basements, crawlspaces, or other wet or marginal zones
  - Tight buildings with high moisture generation and insufficient ventilation or cooling capacity

- **When it's not necessary (or secondary)**
  - Dry or cold climates where humidity is low
  - Buildings where cooling runs long enough to manage latent load
  - Where the main issue is air leakage or ventilation — fix those first

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Check the humidity load and how the envelope and cooling handle it. Add dehumidification when the numbers and conditions require it, not by default.*
