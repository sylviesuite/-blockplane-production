## InsightBox — Deck Boards: Wood, Composite, and Black Locust

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **six common deck board choices**:

1. Pressure-treated pine (PT)
2. Cedar
3. Tropical hardwood (e.g., ipe)
4. Wood–plastic composite (WPC)
5. Mineral / PVC / “advanced composite” boards
6. Black locust

All can produce a durable deck surface. The differences show up in **embodied carbon, durability, maintenance, toxicity, sourcing ethics, and long-term value**.

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### 1. Pressure-Treated Pine (PT)

- Fast-growing softwood, often regionally available.
- Chemically treated for rot and insect resistance.
- Low manufacturing energy for the wood itself; preservative treatment adds impact and toxicity concerns.
- Typical service life: **10–20 years** depending on climate, detailing, and maintenance.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Low upfront carbon, but **shorter lifespan** and chemical treatment raise lifetime impact.

---

### 2. Cedar

- Naturally rot-resistant softwood; no chemical treatment required.
- Moderate embodied energy with **biogenic carbon storage**.
- Longevity depends on:
  - Local climate
  - UV exposure
  - Maintenance (cleaning, finishing as needed)
- Can be sourced more responsibly than redwood or tropical hardwoods when from well-managed forests.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Generally **lower lifecycle impact than PT** when responsibly sourced and maintained.

---

### 3. Tropical Hardwood (e.g., Ipe)

- Extremely dense, hard, and rot-resistant.
- Very long service life: **30–50+ years** when detailed correctly.
- High embodied impact from:
  - Long-distance transport
  - Milling of dense hardwood
- Significant concerns about **deforestation, biodiversity loss, and illegal logging** unless rigorously certified.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Very long life, but **transport + ecosystem impacts** can dominate the carbon story.

---

### 4. Wood–Plastic Composite (WPC)

- Blend of wood fibers and plastic (often recycled content).
- Durable and dimensionally stable; doesn’t require sealing or staining.
- Higher manufacturing energy than solid wood due to plastics and processing.
- End-of-life is challenging: **difficult to recycle**, often landfilled.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Moderate to high embodied impact, partially offset by **long life and low maintenance**.

---

### 5. Mineral / PVC / “Advanced Composite”

- Boards made mostly from PVC or mineral-filled plastics.
- Highest manufacturing energy and **fully fossil-based**.
- Very long service life and consistent appearance.
- Zero biogenic carbon; end-of-life typically landfill or incineration.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Among the **highest embodied carbon** options, despite durability and low maintenance.

---

### 6. Black Locust

- Extremely rot-resistant **temperate hardwood**; often grows in North America and Europe.
- High density and natural durability similar to or better than many tropical hardwoods.
- Can be sourced from **regional forests** or plantations, reducing transport impact.
- Biogenic carbon storage in a **long-lived wood product**.

**LIS snapshot:**  
When regionally sourced and well-managed, **one of the lowest-lifecycle-impact “forever deck” options**: long life + stored carbon + shorter transport.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Durability & maintenance

- **PT Pine**
  - Requires regular cleaning and periodic sealing.
  - Prone to checking, splintering, and warping.
- **Cedar**
  - Ages to a silver-gray if left unfinished.
  - Needs periodic care to maximize lifespan, but more pleasant to handle than PT when weathered.
- **Tropical Hardwood**
  - Extremely durable and dense; resists wear and decay.
  - Needs pre-drilling and sharp tools; can silver out or be oiled.
- **WPC**
  - Low maintenance: no staining or sealing.
  - Can stain or fade somewhat; surface can get hot in full sun.
- **PVC / Mineral Composite**
  - Very low maintenance.
  - Can feel “plastic” underfoot and may have higher thermal expansion and surface heat.
- **Black Locust**
  - Naturally durable, similar to tropical hardwood for lifespan.
  - Can be left to weather or treated with natural oils.

### Health, ecology & ethics

- **PT Pine**
  - Uses preservatives; offcuts and dust must be handled carefully.
- **Cedar**
  - More benign chemistry, especially when left un-coated or finished with low-tox products.
- **Tropical Hardwood**
  - Major ecological impact risk without strong certification.
- **WPC / PVC**
  - Avoids biocide treatment on the deck, but relies on petrochemicals and can be difficult to recycle.
- **Black Locust**
  - Offers **tropical-hardwood-level durability** with the potential for **regional sourcing and better forest governance**.

**RIS verdict:**  
For regenerative goals, **Black Locust and responsibly sourced Cedar** score highest. Tropical hardwoods and PVC-heavy options are more problematic on biodiversity and material-intensity grounds.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Approximate cost ranking (lowest → highest)**

1. PT Pine  
2. Cedar  
3. Wood–Plastic Composite (WPC)  
4. Black Locust (varies by region, often similar to or slightly above composites)  
5. Tropical Hardwood  
6. PVC / Mineral Composite (often comparable to or above tropical hardwoods in some markets)

**Value over time**

- **PT Pine**
  - Lowest upfront, highest lifetime maintenance and replacement risk.
- **Cedar**
  - Middle-of-the-road cost with **good comfort and appearance**; reasonable lifespan if maintained.
- **Tropical Hardwood**
  - High upfront price, very long life; ecological cost can be high.
- **WPC**
  - Higher upfront but low maintenance; strong **cost-per-year-of-service** if aesthetics and plastic feel are acceptable.
- **PVC / Mineral**
  - Expensive, long-lived, low maintenance, but **weak carbon story**.
- **Black Locust**
  - Excellent **cost-per-impact** when available:
    - Long life like tropical hardwood.
    - Lower transport and ecosystem impact.
    - Natural, non-plastic feel.

**CPI verdict:**  
- For **budget projects**: well-detailed **PT Pine** can be acceptable.  
- For **balanced cost + impact**: **Cedar** or **Black Locust** (where available) often win.  
- For **maintenance-averse clients**: **WPC** is the best compromise; PVC-heavy boards rarely win on impact.

## Summary Takeaway

- **Best regenerative balance (where available):**
  - **Black Locust** — long-lived, naturally durable, and regionally sourceable.
- **Best “standard lumberyard” upgrade from PT:**
  - **Cedar** — nicer to live with, lower chemical load, better long-term story.
- **When composites make sense:**
  - Clients who absolutely will not maintain wood and are willing to accept **higher embodied carbon** for lower ongoing work.
- **Use with strong caution:**
  - **Tropical hardwoods** (verify sourcing, certification, and legality).
  - **PVC-heavy boards** when carbon and circularity matter.

**Design guidance:**
- Detail decks for **drainage, airflow, and easy replacement** of surface boards.
- Match deck board lifespan to the **expected life of the structure** instead of burying short-lived boards in hard-to-change assemblies.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you can get Black Locust, it’s the “forever deck” that doesn’t cost the rainforest. If not, choose the simplest wood you’ll actually maintain—and reserve plastics for when maintenance truly isn’t an option.*
