## InsightBox — Comfort Complaints: When the Math Was Right but the House Feels Wrong

### At a glance

This InsightBox addresses **situations where design calculations and equipment sizing are correct, yet occupants still report discomfort** — cold spots, drafts, uneven temperatures, or "it never feels right."

The gap between calculated performance and lived experience often comes from distribution, radiant effects, control placement, or occupant behavior. The math can be right and the house can still feel wrong. Fixing that gap requires looking beyond load calculations and nameplate capacity.

**Core idea:**  
Comfort is felt, not just calculated. When the numbers look good but the building does not feel good, the cause is usually in how and where conditioning is delivered, or in factors the math did not capture.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Common contributors**
- **Distribution:** Air or water may not reach some rooms equally. Duct layout, balance, or zoning can leave certain areas under-served. The load calc may be satisfied at the equipment while some zones stay cold or hot.
- **Radiant effects:** Large cold surfaces (e.g., single-pane or poorly insulated glazing, uninsulated slabs) make people feel cold even when air temperature is adequate. The opposite occurs with hot sun on glass. Thermostats measure air, not radiant exchange.
- **Thermostat location and control:** A single thermostat in a neutral location may not represent conditions in bedrooms or at the perimeter. Setbacks and setpoints can create recovery issues or perceived "the system never catches up."
- **Stratification and drafts:** In tall spaces or near leaky windows and doors, stratification or cold downdrafts can make occupied zones feel uncomfortable even when average temperature is on target.

**Consequences**
- Occupants may override setpoints, add space heaters or window units, or lose confidence in the design. Energy use and callbacks rise. The building is "performing" on paper but not in practice.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> When the math is right but comfort is wrong, the cause is often distribution, radiant temperature, control location, or stratification. Addressing those reduces callbacks and improves real-world performance.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Trust and satisfaction**
- Repeated comfort complaints undermine trust in high-performance design. Resolving the underlying causes (rather than blaming occupants or equipment size) supports long-term satisfaction and referral.
- Calm, systematic troubleshooting — where is it cold, when does it happen, what does the occupant feel — leads to better fixes than adding more capacity.

**Durability**
- Overriding thermostats, adding plug-in heaters, or running systems at extremes can increase wear and energy use. Fixing the root cause of discomfort reduces those workarounds and extends equipment life.

**Unintended consequences**
- Adding more capacity when the problem is distribution or radiant effect can make cycling worse and still not fix the complaint. The fix is often delivery and control, not more BTU.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Closing the gap between calculated and felt comfort supports occupant trust and system longevity. The solution is usually delivery and control, not bigger equipment.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Diagnosis**
- Time spent understanding where and why occupants are uncomfortable — which rooms, what time of day, what they feel — is low cost compared to replacing equipment or adding supplemental systems that do not address the cause.
- Simple checks: balance at registers, thermostat location, presence of cold surfaces or drafts.

**Fixes**
- Rebalancing ducts, adjusting zoning, moving or adding sensors, or improving radiant conditions (e.g., window treatments, perimeter heat) often cost less than a larger unit or a second system.
- Addressing distribution and control usually improves comfort and can reduce energy use by eliminating over-conditioning or occupant overrides.

**Value**
- Investment in delivery and control typically has better cost-per-impact than adding capacity when the underlying issue is not capacity.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> When the math was right but the house feels wrong, spending on distribution, control placement, and radiant balance usually delivers better comfort per dollar than spending on more equipment.

### Summary Takeaway

- **When math is right but comfort is wrong**
  - Look at distribution (balance, zoning, delivery to problem rooms)
  - Consider radiant effects (cold or hot surfaces, glazing)
  - Check thermostat location and whether it represents occupied zones
  - Consider stratification and drafts

- **Avoid**
  - Assuming the problem is undersizing when load calc and equipment are appropriate
  - Adding capacity without diagnosing where and why discomfort occurs

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *If the numbers say it should be comfortable and it isn’t, the problem is usually where and how the conditioning gets there — or what the thermostat can’t see.*
