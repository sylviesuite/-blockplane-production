## Gold InsightBox Reference

This folder stores the “Gold” versions of InsightBox content—the production-ready narratives that set the standard for every InsightBox output we ship.

Every file here must be grounded in real data (no mock numbers or placeholders) and represent the full depth of the story we want InsightBox to tell: context, analysis, confidence, and next actions that would be brand-safe if delivered to a customer.

Think of these as canonical templates for style, tone, hierarchy, and structure. Designers, researchers, and engineers should point to one of these examples when they need clarity about how an InsightBox should feel.

Future InsightBoxes (static, AI, or hybrid) should reference these gold standards for formatting, spacing, language, and rigor before they reach the UI. Use them as your benchmark before you ship new insights.
