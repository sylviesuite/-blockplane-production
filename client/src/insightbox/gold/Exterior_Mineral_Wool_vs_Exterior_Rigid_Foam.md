## InsightBox — Exterior Mineral Wool vs Exterior Rigid Foam

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two common strategies for adding **continuous exterior insulation**:
- **Mineral wool boards**
- **Rigid foam insulation (EPS, XPS, polyiso)**

Both improve thermal performance and reduce thermal bridging, but they differ significantly in embodied impact, moisture behavior, fire performance, and long-term durability.

**The core tradeoff**
- Mineral wool prioritizes **durability, vapor openness, and fire resistance**
- Rigid foam prioritizes **high R-value per inch and ease of installation**

---

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied energy & carbon**
- Rigid foams are petrochemical products with **high embodied energy** and, in some cases, high global warming potential (especially XPS). For polyiso, reference values are ~100 MJ/kg embodied energy, ~0.027 W/m·K thermal conductivity, ~6.5 R per inch (values can vary with temperature).
- Mineral wool has higher manufacturing energy than fiberglass but **lower climate impact than most rigid foams** when normalized per assembly performance.

**Longevity**
- Mineral wool maintains thermal performance over time and is not affected by UV or temperature cycling.
- Some rigid foams can lose performance, become brittle, or degrade when exposed during construction or over decades.

**Moisture behavior**
- Mineral wool is vapor-permeable, allowing assemblies to dry outward.
- Rigid foam restricts outward drying, increasing reliance on perfect interior vapor control.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Mineral wool often delivers **lower lifecycle risk** even if its initial embodied energy is comparable or slightly higher than some foams.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Fire safety**
- Mineral wool is non-combustible and improves overall fire resilience.
- Rigid foam requires ignition barriers and careful detailing to manage fire risk.

**Assembly resilience**
- Vapor-open mineral wool supports moisture-tolerant wall systems.
- Foam-based assemblies are less forgiving of air or vapor control errors.

**Material health**
- Mineral wool contains no blowing agents and avoids long-term microplastic shedding.
- Foam insulation contributes to plastic persistence and end-of-life disposal challenges.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Mineral wool aligns more strongly with **durability, safety, and long-term material responsibility**.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Mineral wool boards typically cost more per inch than EPS or polyiso.
- Installation labor can be slightly higher due to board density and fastening requirements.

**Value per outcome**
- Mineral wool reduces risk-related costs (moisture, fire, callbacks).
- Foam delivers lower first cost but may increase long-term risk exposure.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Foam can be cheaper upfront, but mineral wool often delivers **better cost-per-impact when durability and risk are included**.

---

### Summary Takeaway

- Use **rigid foam** when thickness is constrained and budgets are tight.
- Use **mineral wool** when durability, fire safety, and moisture robustness matter.
- In high-performance or long-life buildings, mineral wool is often the safer long-term choice.

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Foam buys R-value. Mineral wool buys forgiveness.*
