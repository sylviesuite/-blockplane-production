## InsightBox — Exterior Mineral Wool vs Exterior Rigid Foam

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two common strategies for **continuous exterior insulation**:
- **Exterior mineral wool boards** — stone/slag fiber; vapor-open; around R-4 per inch; non-combustible; moderate embodied energy
- **Rigid foam boards (EPS, XPS, polyiso)** — petrochemical; higher R per inch (e.g. R-5 to ~6.5); thinner profile for same R; vapor-resistant; higher embodied carbon in many cases

Both improve thermal performance and reduce thermal bridging. Differences show up in **embodied carbon, vapor openness, fire resistance, thickness for given R, and cost**.

**Core idea:**  
Mineral wool typically delivers lower embodied carbon, vapor openness, and fire resistance; rigid foam delivers **higher R per inch** and a **thinner profile**—use foam where thickness is constrained and mineral wool where durability, drying, and fire safety matter.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied carbon**
- **Rigid foams** are petrochemical products with **high embodied energy** and, in some cases, high GWP (especially XPS). Documented XPS: density ≈35 kg/m³ (30–45), λ ≈0.030 W/m·K (0.029–0.036), R-5 per inch (R-4.5–5.6), embodied energy ≈90 MJ/kg (80–100). Polyiso reference values are on the order of ~100 MJ/kg embodied energy, ~0.027 W/m·K, ~6.5 R per inch (varies with temperature).
- **Exterior mineral wool boards** are documented in the **~30–80 kg/m³** density range for exterior boards (e.g. ~45 kg/m³ typical), **around R-4 per inch** (typically R-3.3–R-4.3 per inch), and **moderate embodied energy**—higher than cellulose, lower than XPS and polyiso—so they often deliver **lower lifecycle impact** when normalized per assembly performance. (See project material docs for approved values and ranges.)

**Longevity**
- Mineral wool **maintains thermal performance** over time and is not affected by UV or temperature cycling. Some rigid foams can lose performance, become brittle, or degrade when exposed during construction or over decades.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Mineral wool often has **lower embodied carbon and lifecycle impact** than exterior rigid foam (XPS, polyiso) per unit of assembly performance; foam’s higher R per inch comes with higher embodied cost and, in some products, long-term drift.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Vapor openness & drying**
- Mineral wool is **vapor-permeable**, allowing assemblies to **dry outward** and reducing reliance on perfect interior vapor control.
- Rigid foam **restricts outward drying**; assemblies depend more on interior vapor control and careful detailing to avoid trapping moisture.

**Fire resistance**
- Mineral wool is **non-combustible** and can improve overall fire resilience.
- Rigid foam typically **requires ignition barriers** and careful detailing to manage fire risk.

**Thermal bridging control**
- Both **continuous exterior insulation** layers reduce thermal bridging across framing. Thicker mineral wool (for the same R) can slightly improve bridging at fasteners and edges if detailing is consistent; foam’s thinner profile can simplify some details but does not change the need for continuous coverage and proper attachment.

**Material health & end of life**
- Mineral wool contains no blowing agents and avoids long-term blowing-gas emissions; foam contributes to plastic persistence and end-of-life disposal challenges. Mineral wool recycling and reuse pathways are more established in many regions.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Mineral wool often aligns better with **vapor openness, drying potential, fire resistance, and long-term material responsibility**; foam is a better fit where **thinner profile and higher R per inch** are required and fire/moisture risk are managed.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- **Rigid foam** (especially EPS) is often **cheaper per inch** and can be faster to install; polyiso and XPS command a premium. **Mineral wool boards** typically **cost more per inch**; labor can be slightly higher due to density and fastening.

**Return on investment**
- **Foam’s thinner profile and higher R per inch** can justify cost where cladding clearances or code R-values are tight. **Mineral wool’s** moisture and fire advantages often **reduce risk-related costs** (callbacks, remediation, insurance). When durability and risk are included, mineral wool often delivers better cost-per-impact for long-life or high-performance buildings.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Foam can be **cheaper upfront** and pays off where **thickness is constrained** and higher R per inch is needed. Mineral wool often delivers **better cost-per-impact** when **durability, fire safety, and moisture robustness** are valued.

### Performance notes

- **Thermal bridging:** Both continuous exterior insulation strategies **reduce thermal bridging** across studs and plates. Effectiveness depends on thickness, continuity, and fastener detailing. Mineral wool’s typically greater thickness for the same R can improve bridging at penetrations and edges when details are consistent; foam’s thinner profile achieves similar R with less build-out, which can simplify cladding and trim.
- **Thickness differences:** **Rigid foam** typically delivers **higher R per inch** (e.g. R-5 for XPS, up to ~6.5 for polyiso) than **mineral wool** (around R-4 per inch, range R-3.3–R-4.3 for exterior boards). For a given target R, mineral wool requires **greater thickness** than foam; foam suits **space-constrained** assemblies.
- **Drying potential:** **Mineral wool** is **vapor-open** and allows **outward drying**, which supports moisture-tolerant assemblies and reduces risk if interior vapor control is imperfect. **Rigid foam** is **vapor-resistant** and restricts outward drying, so interior vapor control and drying paths must be designed explicitly to avoid trapping moisture.

### Installation & risk

- Mineral wool boards are **denser and heavier**; fastening and cutting need appropriate tools and sequencing. Rigid foam cuts easily but requires **continuous taping** at seams for air and weather control; some foams need protection from UV and impact during construction. Both benefit from continuous attachment and flashing at transitions; failure to maintain continuity or to manage vapor paths can increase long-term risk and CPI.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Exterior mineral wool**:
  - Prefer when **durability, fire safety, vapor openness, and moisture robustness** matter; suitable for high-performance and long-life buildings
  - Lower embodied carbon (vs XPS/polyiso); vapor-permeable; non-combustible; typically greater thickness for same R

- **Rigid foam (EPS, XPS, polyiso)**:
  - Use when **thickness is constrained**, budgets are tight, or **higher R per inch** is needed in space-limited assemblies
  - Thinner profile for given R; often lower upfront cost; vapor-resistant—requires careful vapor and fire detailing

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Foam buys R per inch and a thinner profile. Mineral wool buys vapor openness, fire resistance, and forgiveness when details aren’t perfect.*
