## InsightBox — Hempcrete vs Fiberglass/Stud Walls

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **hempcrete infill walls** (non-structural hemp-lime around a frame) versus **conventional stud walls with fiberglass batts**.

Both can meet code-level thermal performance. The real differences show up in **carbon story, moisture behavior, durability, and construction culture**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied energy & carbon**

- **Hempcrete**
  - Made from **hemp hurd + lime binder + water**, cast or sprayed around a frame.
  - Hemp hurd is a **rapidly renewable bio-based material** that stores biogenic carbon.
  - Lime binder carries a higher manufacturing impact but can **re-carbonate over time**.
  - Overall, hempcrete can be **very low-carbon or near net-zero** depending on mix, sourcing, and thickness.
- **Fiberglass/Stud Wall**
  - Wood studs, sheathing, fiberglass batts, and typically OSB + cladding.
  - Fiberglass has **moderate embodied energy** with no carbon storage benefit.
  - Lumber stores some biogenic carbon but is often offset by other high-impact components (foams, membranes, finishes).

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **Hempcrete infill walls generally have a much lower lifecycle impact**, especially when hemp is regionally sourced and assemblies stay bio-based.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & hygrothermal behavior**

- **Hempcrete**
  - **Vapor-open, hygroscopic, and capillary-active**: it can absorb, redistribute, and release moisture.
  - Functions as a combined **insulation + hygrothermal buffer**, helping keep interior conditions more stable.
  - Requires vapor-open exterior finishes and good detailing to avoid bulk-water exposure.
- **Fiberglass/Stud Wall**
  - Fiberglass itself does not store or redistribute moisture.
  - Performance depends heavily on **separate air and vapor control layers**.
  - Air leaks can carry moisture into cold zones, raising condensation and mold risk.

**Durability & fire**

- **Hempcrete**
  - Does not burn in the same way as fibrous batts; char layer and lime content provide **high fire resistance**.
  - Pest-resistant and not appealing as food or nesting material.
  - Massive, “monolithic” infill can handle small leaks more gracefully if allowed to dry.
- **Fiberglass/Stud Wall**
  - Non-combustible glass fibers, but **studs and sheathing remain vulnerable**.
  - Cavities can hide moisture problems; fiberglass does not protect framing if detailing fails.

**Repairability & future flexibility**

- Hempcrete creates a **solid, integrated wall layer** that is durable but slower to modify.
- Conventional stud + fiberglass walls are easy to cut open and patch but **less forgiving** if repeated changes damage air/vapor control.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Hempcrete scores higher** on regenerative metrics: bio-based inputs, moisture buffering, fire resistance, and long-term durability—provided detailing respects its vapor-open nature.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Hempcrete**
  - Higher labor cost and longer install time (forming, casting/spraying, curing).
  - Material cost varies by region but is often **higher than fiberglass batts per unit R**.
  - Requires crews trained in mixes, curing, and detailing.
- **Fiberglass/Stud Wall**
  - One of the **lowest-cost standard assemblies**.
  - Widely available materials and crews.
  - Familiar to inspectors, engineers, and trades.

**Value over time**

- Hempcrete:
  - Can reduce **maintenance and repair risk** through moisture buffering and durability.
  - Offers comfort benefits (thermal mass, hygrothermal stability, sound).
- Fiberglass/stud:
  - Delivers decent performance **only when paired with strong air-sealing and vapor control**.
  - More likely to see performance drift from air leaks, renovations, or minor water events.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> On pure first cost, **fiberglass/stud walls win easily**. On **cost-per-unit-of-impact over decades** (carbon, durability, moisture resilience), **hempcrete can be the better value** in the right projects.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for low-carbon, regenerative envelopes:**
  - **Hempcrete infill walls**, where local supply, crew skills, and schedule can support them.
- **When fiberglass/stud is acceptable:**
  - Budget-driven projects, or where the team is not ready for alternative assemblies, provided there is **excellent air-sealing and moisture detailing**.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Use hempcrete where you want the wall itself to **manage moisture, carbon, and comfort**, not just “hold insulation.”
  - Treat conventional stud + fiberglass walls as a **commodity baseline** that must be upgraded with smart control layers to approach similar performance.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If the project can carry it, build the wall out of plants and stone. If you must stay conventional, make the control layers flawless.*
