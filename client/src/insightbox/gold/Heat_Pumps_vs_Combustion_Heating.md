## InsightBox — Heat Pumps vs Combustion Heating

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two fundamentally different heating strategies:
- **Electric heat pumps** (air-source or ground-source)
- **Combustion heating** (natural gas, propane, oil)

Both can heat a building effectively, but they differ sharply in efficiency, emissions, safety, and long-term resilience.

**Core idea:**  
Heat pumps move heat; combustion systems create it.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Combustion heating**
- Lower upfront equipment cost
- Ongoing fuel combustion produces direct CO₂ emissions
- Efficiency capped by combustion physics

**Heat pumps**
- Higher upfront embodied impact
- Deliver 2–4 units of heat for every unit of electricity used
- Operational emissions decline as grids decarbonize

**System interaction**
- Heat pumps pair best with airtight, well-insulated envelopes
- Combustion systems tolerate higher heat loss but lock in emissions

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Over a building's lifespan, heat pumps almost always produce **lower total emissions**, especially in cold and mixed climates with improving grids.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Health & safety**
- No on-site combustion
- No carbon monoxide risk
- Reduced indoor air pollution

**Resilience**
- Heat pumps can operate from renewable electricity
- Compatible with solar, batteries, and future grid improvements
- Support passive survivability when paired with a good envelope

**Future adaptability**
- Combustion systems depend on fuel availability and pricing
- Heat pumps align with electrification and policy trends

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Heat pumps support safer, cleaner, and more adaptable buildings over time.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Heat pumps cost more initially
- Installation quality matters more than brand

**Operating cost**
- Heat pumps are often cheaper to run per BTU delivered
- Reduced maintenance compared to combustion systems

**System downsizing**
- Good envelopes allow smaller heat pumps
- Savings often come from right-sizing, not equipment alone

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Heat pumps deliver better cost-per-impact when paired with envelope improvements and smart sizing.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Combustion heating**
  - Familiar and often cheaper upfront
  - Locks in fuel dependence and emissions
  - Increasing regulatory and cost risk

- **Heat pumps**
  - Higher initial investment
  - Lower operating emissions
  - Align with high-performance envelopes and future energy systems

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Build the envelope first — then let a smaller heat pump do the rest.*
