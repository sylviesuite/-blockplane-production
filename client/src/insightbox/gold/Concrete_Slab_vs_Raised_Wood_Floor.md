## InsightBox — Concrete Slab vs Raised Wood Floor

### At a glance
This comparison looks at **concrete slab-on-grade floors** versus **raised wood
floor systems** (joists, subfloor, and finishes), two common foundation and floor
approaches in residential construction.

Both can meet code and deliver durable results, but they differ significantly in
**embodied impact, moisture behavior, adaptability, and long-term flexibility**.

---

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)
- **Concrete slabs** typically have:
  - Higher embodied energy and carbon due to cement production
  - Long service life with minimal structural maintenance
  - Strong thermal mass benefits when paired with insulation
- **Raised wood floors** generally show:
  - Lower embodied energy per square foot
  - Reduced upfront carbon footprint
  - More components and detailing that influence long-term performance

Over a full lifecycle, slabs carry a higher initial impact, while raised wood floors
often perform better on embodied metrics but may require more maintenance.

---

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)
- **Raised wood floors** score higher on RIS because they:
  - Rely on renewable structural materials
  - Allow easier access for repair, retrofits, and future changes
  - Support adaptability over a building’s life
- **Concrete slabs** provide durability but:
  - Lock in systems permanently
  - Limit repairability and future modification
  - Depend on extractive, high-carbon materials

RIS reflects how easily a system can **adapt, recover, and evolve** rather than
simply how long it lasts.

---

### Cost Per Impact (CPI)
- **Concrete slabs** often appear cost-effective due to:
  - Simplified construction sequencing
  - Reduced framing labor
  - Integration with radiant heating systems
- **Raised wood floors** may carry higher framing and labor costs, but CPI improves
  when accounting for:
  - Easier repairs
  - System access
  - Reduced demolition in future renovations

CPI varies strongly by climate, soil conditions, and local labor markets.

---

### Takeaway
If the priority is **simplicity, durability, and thermal mass**, concrete slabs
remain a proven solution, especially in slab-friendly climates.

If the goal is **lower embodied impact, adaptability, and regenerative alignment**,
raised wood floors offer flexibility that supports long-term building resilience.

BlockPlane reflects this by scoring raised wood floors higher on regenerative
criteria, while recognizing the performance advantages slabs can provide.

---

### Notes
- Slab performance depends heavily on insulation placement and detailing.
- Raised floor durability varies by moisture control and crawlspace design.
- Scores reflect typical North American residential construction practices.
