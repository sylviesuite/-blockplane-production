## InsightBox — Continuous Exterior Insulation vs Cavity-Only Walls

### At a glance

This comparison looks at:
- **Cavity-only walls** (insulation between studs only)
- **Walls with continuous exterior insulation** (rigid or semi-rigid insulation outside the sheathing)

Both can hit code-minimum R-values, but their **real performance, moisture behavior, and lifecycle impact** are very different.

**Core idea:**  
Cavity-only walls are cheaper and simpler, but thermal bridging and moisture risks eat into performance. Continuous exterior insulation adds cost and complexity but delivers a more resilient, energy-efficient envelope.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Thermal bridging**
- Cavity-only: Studs bypass insulation, creating cold stripes and lower effective R-value.
- Exterior continuous: Wraps the structure, greatly reducing thermal bridges.

**Material and embodied carbon**
- Cavity-only: Less material, lower upfront embodied impact.
- Exterior insulation: More material (foam, mineral wool, or wood fiber) raises embodied energy, but improved performance can reduce operational emissions over time.

**Durability**
- Continuous exterior insulation warms the sheathing, reducing condensation risk and extending service life.
- Cavity-only walls leave sheathing cold in winter, especially in colder climates, raising the chance of hidden moisture problems.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Cavity-only walls win on **low upfront materials**; exterior continuous insulation wins on **whole-assembly performance and durability**.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture management**
- Cavity-only relies heavily on perfect interior air/vapor control.
- Exterior insulation shifts the dew point outward, making the assembly more forgiving and stable.

**Comfort and resilience**
- Exterior insulated walls have more even interior surface temperatures, reducing drafts and cold spots.
- They also pair well with high-performance windows and HVAC systems for low-load buildings.

**Future adaptability**
- Cavity-only: Harder to upgrade later without major interior work.
- Exterior continuous: Can sometimes be thickened or modified from the outside during re-cladding.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Continuous exterior insulation delivers a **more resilient, moisture-safe, comfort-focused** wall assembly.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Cavity-only is the cheapest and fastest to build—familiar to most crews.
- Exterior insulation adds:
  - Extra material cost
  - Furring, fasteners, and detailing effort
  - Potential learning curve for trades

**Value per performance**
- Cavity-only walls often fall short of their "nameplate R-value" because of thermal bridging.
- Exterior insulation increases effective R-value and can shrink HVAC size and operating costs.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> In mild climates or budget-constrained projects, cavity-only may be acceptable.  
> In colder or performance-focused builds, spending more on exterior continuous insulation usually **pays back in comfort, resilience, and operating savings.**

### Summary Takeaway

- **Cavity-only walls**:  
  - Lower cost and complexity  
  - Higher risk of thermal bridging and moisture issues  
  - Best reserved for mild climates and basic performance targets

- **Walls with continuous exterior insulation**:  
  - Higher up-front cost  
  - Stronger thermal performance and moisture safety  
  - Align with high-performance, net-zero, or long-lifespan projects

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *If you're serious about comfort and durability in a cold or mixed climate, put the coat on the outside, not just a sweater between the studs.*
