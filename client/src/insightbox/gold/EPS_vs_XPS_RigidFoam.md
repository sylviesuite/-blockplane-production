## InsightBox — EPS vs XPS Rigid Foam

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two rigid foam options for sheathing, roofs, and below-grade edges:
- **EPS (expanded polystyrene)** — bead foam, lower density; vapor-permeable; typical R-4 per inch; stable long-term R; lower embodied carbon
- **XPS (extruded polystyrene)** — extruded foam, higher density; lower permeability; typical R-5 per inch initially; R can drift down over time; higher embodied carbon

Both fill the rigid foam slot in above-grade walls, roof assemblies, and foundation edges. Differences show up in **embodied impact, R per inch, long-term R stability, moisture behavior, and cost**.

**Core idea:**  
EPS typically wins on embodied carbon, moisture tolerance, and long-term R stability; XPS offers higher initial R per inch and compressive strength—use it where that justifies the premium and where moisture or thermal drift are manageable.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied impact**
- EPS: beads melted with relatively low heat; GWP per board foot stays low. Documented ranges: density ≈20 kg/m³ (10–35), λ ≈0.036 W/m·K (0.032–0.040), R-4 per inch typical (R-3.8–4.2); embodied energy ≈90 MJ/kg (80–110), embodied carbon ≈2.5 kg CO₂e/kg (2–3). XPS: extruded under high pressure with fossil-fed blowing agents; **substantially higher** embodied carbon than EPS at equivalent thickness. Documented XPS: density ≈35 kg/m³ (30–45), λ ≈0.030 W/m·K (0.029–0.036), R-5 per inch (R-4.5–5.6), embodied energy ≈90 MJ/kg (80–100).

**Blowing agents & long-term thermal drift**
- Older XPS used **high-GWP HFCs**; newer HFO blends still diffuse out over time, reducing R-value and releasing greenhouse gases. EPS typically uses **pentane or CO₂**, which either escape early with minimal impact or stay locked—long-term carbon cost is much smaller. XPS starts with **higher initial R per inch** (≈ R-5) but effective R can **drop over 10–20 years** as gases escape; EPS starts lower (≈ R-4) but **stays stable** because the bead structure does not rely on trapped blowing gases.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> EPS typically has **lower embodied impact** and **stable long-term R**; XPS has higher initial R per inch but embodied carbon and thermal drift favor EPS over the life of the building unless XPS is required for structural or moisture-resistant reasons.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture behavior & drying**
- EPS is **vapor-permeable enough** to let assemblies dry; when wetted it typically **returns to rated R-value after drying**. XPS’s closed-cell structure resists bulk water but can **trap moisture** against sheathing or below-grade surfaces, stressing adhesives or vapor barriers if vapor paths are not controlled.

**Below-grade durability & compressive strength**
- XPS has **higher compressive strength** and is often specified where loads or legacy details demand it. Below grade, misused XPS can trap water and degrade adhesives. EPS is **more forgiving** in many below-grade applications where long-term stability and permeability keep assemblies healthy, though it still needs protection from UV and fire-facing.

**Compatibility & moisture risk**
- EPS’s **drying capability** fits moisture-tolerant systems (e.g. wood fiber, mineral wool, rainscreens). XPS’s low permeability can trap vapor in thick facade stacks; without controlled vapor paths, condensation can stress adhesives and claddings. EPS recycling is more established; XPS recycling remains limited.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> EPS often scores better on **moisture tolerance, drying potential, and below-grade durability** where permeability is an asset. XPS is a better fit where **compressive strength or legacy specs** require it, provided moisture and thermal drift are addressed.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- EPS is **usually cheaper** at typical thicknesses; XPS commands a **premium** for density and rigidity. The gap widens when drainage or moisture protection are factored into XPS assemblies.

**Return on investment**
- Because EPS **holds its rated R-value** and XPS can degrade over time, **cost per durable R-value** often favors EPS unless XPS is explicitly needed for structural loads or space-limited R. Labor: EPS cuts easily (e.g. hot-wire) and takes standard adhesives but needs care to avoid crushing; XPS is tougher for high-traffic installs but requires precise taping for continuous insulation.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> EPS **usually delivers better cost-per-impact** for equivalent durable R. XPS tends to pay off where **compressive strength, higher initial R per inch, or legacy specs** justify the added cost—and where thickness or drainage is designed for long-term performance.

### Performance notes

- **R per inch:** XPS has **higher initial R per inch** (documented ≈ R-5 per inch, range R-4.5–5.6) than EPS (typical R-4 per inch, range R-3.8–4.2). For the same nominal R, EPS needs slightly more thickness.
- **Long-term R-value stability:** XPS **effective R can decline over 10–20 years** as blowing gases diffuse out; EPS **R-value remains stable** because it does not rely on trapped gases. Design with “durable R” in mind when comparing options.
- **Water absorption & drying:** EPS can absorb some moisture but is **vapor-open enough to dry** and typically recovers rated R after drying. XPS **resists bulk water** but is less permeable; it can trap moisture against adjacent layers if drying paths are not provided, which can reduce R and stress the assembly.

---

### Installation & risk

- EPS cuts easily but can be **crushed** if handled roughly; protect from UV and meet fire-facing requirements. XPS needs **precise taping** at seams for continuous insulation and careful detailing below grade to avoid trapping water. Both require appropriate adhesives and attachment; failure from misuse (e.g. XPS trapping water, EPS UV degradation) raises real repair and CPI cost.

### Summary Takeaway

- **EPS**:
  - Default when **long-term carbon, drying capacity, and R stability** matter; suitable for above-grade sheathing, continuous insulation, and many below-grade applications
  - Lower embodied carbon; vapor-permeable; stable R over time; usually lower cost per durable R

- **XPS**:
  - Use when **compressive strength or legacy specs** demand it, or where higher initial R per inch is needed in space-limited assemblies
  - Limit exposure to situations where **moisture and thermal drift** are managed (drainage, thickness, vapor paths). Expect initial R advantage to erode over 10–20 years unless over-designed.

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Prefer EPS unless you need XPS’s compressive strength or higher initial R per inch. Where possible, consider mineral wool, wood fiber, or foam glass for lower petrochemical impact.*
