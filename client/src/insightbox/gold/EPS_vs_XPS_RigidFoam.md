## InsightBox — EPS vs XPS Rigid Foam

### At a glance
EPS and XPS both fill the rigid foam slot in above-grade wall sheathing, roof assemblies, and below-grade foundation edges, but they are often chosen for the wrong reasons. XPS starts with higher density, compressive strength, and R-value per inch, which makes it feel superior on paper. EPS wins on moisture tolerance, embodied carbon, and long-term dimensional stability, yet it is cast aside because installers perceive it as “less rigid.” This comparison untangles where each foam actually belongs and when builders should question legacy specs in favor of cleaner, longer-lasting rigidity.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)
- **Embodied energy & GWP** – EPS melts recycled beads with relatively low heat, so its GWP per board foot stays low. XPS extrudes molten polystyrene under high pressure and relies on fossil-fed blowing agents, which drives its embodied carbon 2–3× higher than EPS in equivalent thicknesses.
- **Blowing agents** – Older XPS boards used HFCs with high global warming potential, and even newer HFO blends still slowly diffuse out, reducing R-value over time and releasing trapped greenhouse gases. EPS typically uses pentane or CO₂, which either escapes quickly with minimal impact or stays locked, so the long-term carbon cost is far smaller.
- **Density and R-value per inch** – XPS looks better on the data sheet because its higher density allows more polymer per inch and a higher initial R-value, but as gases escape the effective R-value drops by ~5–10 % over 10–20 years. EPS begins lower but stays stable because the bead structure does not rely on trapped gases.
- **Moisture absorption and drying** – EPS is vapor-permeable enough to let assemblies dry, and when wet it almost always returns to its rated R-value after drying. XPS’s closed-cell nature resists bulk water but can trap moisture against sheathing or below-grade surfaces, which stresses adhesives or vapor barriers.
- **Expected service life** – EPS can last the life of the building with minimal change; XPS’s thermal drift and potential compression under long-term loads shorten its practical service life unless designers increase thickness to compensate.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)
- **Long-term carbon implications** – EPS’s low-GWP blowing agents and higher recycled content mean it stores carbon rather than emitting it. XPS continues to lose gas to the atmosphere, so its carbon profile worsens over time, even if the initial carbon gap appears small.
- **Microplastic and end-of-life concerns** – Both are petrochemical and resist biodegradation, but EPS is easier to recycle and the beads can be reused in new boards or landscaping while XPS recycling remains limited and more expensive.
- **Compatibility with regenerative assemblies** – EPS’s drying capability makes it suitable with moisture-tolerant systems such as wood fiber, mineral wool, or rainscreens that demand vapor openness. XPS’s low permeability can clash with these assemblies and trap vapor, increasing moisture risk in wide facade stacks.
- **Risk of trapping moisture** – XPS can sit against sheathing or structure and, without controlled vapor paths, keep condensation in place, which stresses adhesives and claddings. EPS’s permeance and dimensional stability reduce that risk, meaning the assembly can recover after incidental wetting without long-term harm.

### Cost Per Impact (CPI)
- **Upfront cost per square foot** – EPS is usually cheaper at typical thicknesses, while XPS commands a premium for density and rigidity. The price gap widens when ventilation, drainage, or moisture protection are factored into XPS assemblies.
- **Cost per durable R-value** – Since EPS keeps its rated R-value and XPS can degrade, the long-term cost per effective R-value favors EPS unless XPS is explicitly needed for structural loads. Builders should think about "cost per durable R" rather than sticker price.
- **Labor differences** – EPS boards cut easily with hot-wire tools and fasten with standard adhesives, but they require care to avoid crushing. XPS is tougher, so crews favor it for high-traffic install areas, yet its rigid edges need precise taping to maintain continuous insulation.
- **Failure costs** – Misused XPS below grade can trap water, degrade adhesives, and lead to early remediation. EPS is more forgiving in tight cavities but still requires protection from UV and fire-facing to avoid degradation. The real failure cost includes repair and downtime, which raises CPI for both when assemblies are mishandled.

### Summary takeaway
- **Use EPS** when long-term carbon goals matter, drying capacity is essential, and the structure can tolerate slightly lower initial R-values. It's a safe pick for above-grade sheathing, continuous insulation, and most below-grade use cases where long-term stability and permeability keep assemblies healthy.
- **Use XPS cautiously** when compressive strength or legacy specs demand it, but limit its exposure to situations where moisture or thermal drift are manageable. Increase thickness or pair with drainage and protective layers, and be honest that the initial R-value advantage may erode within 10–20 years unless over-designed.
- **Move beyond both** when regenerative alternatives such as foam glass, mineral wool, or wood fiber assemblies can deliver similar performance with far lower petrochemical impact. Reserve EPS/XPS for situations where those alternatives cannot meet the structural or moisture-resistant needs, and document the trade-off clearly in the specification.
