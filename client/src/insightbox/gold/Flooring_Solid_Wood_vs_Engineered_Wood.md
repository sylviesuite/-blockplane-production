## InsightBox — Solid Wood vs Engineered Wood Flooring

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **solid hardwood flooring** (one species, full thickness) versus **engineered wood flooring** (wood veneer over a layered substrate).

Both can deliver a warm, durable wood floor. The differences show up in **stability, refinishing potential, embodied impact, and how they behave over decades**.

---

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Solid Wood

- Single species, full-thickness boards.
- Can be **sanded and refinished multiple times**.
- Wood is both the finished surface and the structure; minimal glue.
- Higher total wood volume per square foot.

**LIS snapshot:**  
High biogenic carbon storage; more material per square foot but **very long service life** if maintained.

---

### Engineered Wood

- Thin hardwood wear layer over a **plywood or HDF core**.
- Uses **more glue and processing** than solid wood.
- Can use lower-grade or fast-growing wood in core layers.
- Refinishing is limited by **veneer thickness** (often 1–3 sandings max, sometimes none).

**LIS snapshot:**  
Lower total hardwood volume, but more adhesives and processing. Lifecycle impact depends heavily on:
- Veneer thickness (how long it lasts)
- Glue chemistry
- Sourcing of core materials.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Dimensional stability & climate

- **Solid Wood**
  - Expands and contracts with humidity.
  - Sensitive to:
    - Seasonal swings
    - Radiant heat
    - High-moisture spaces
  - Wants careful acclimation and detailing.
- **Engineered Wood**
  - Cross-laminated or layered cores resist movement.
  - Better for:
    - Wide-plank looks
    - Radiant floors
    - Basements / edge cases (within manufacturer limits).

### Repair & longevity

- Solid:
  - Can be **re-sanded many times**.
  - Easy to patch with matching boards.
  - Realistic lifespan: **50–100 years** in cared-for buildings.
- Engineered:
  - Refinishing depends on wear layer.
  - Some products are “screen and recoat only” (no deep sanding).
  - Lifespan: **15–40 years** depending on quality and use.

**RIS verdict:**  
For long-lived buildings with stable conditions, **solid wood is the regenerative winner**. Engineered wood is better where movement control and installation flexibility are critical.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Solid Wood**
  - Often higher material + finishing labor cost.
  - Site-finished floors add time and dust.
- **Engineered Wood**
  - Wide range:
    - Budget click-together products
    - High-end, thick-veneer planks
  - Many are **factory-finished**, speeding installation.

### Lifetime value

- Solid:
  - Higher upfront, but **can outlast multiple remodel cycles**.
  - Strong cost-per-year when building lifespan is long.
- Engineered:
  - Lower upfront (especially budget lines), but:
    - Shorter lifespan for thin veneers.
    - Replacement more likely during major remodels.

**CPI verdict:**  
- For **homes expected to last many decades**, **solid wood usually wins on cost-per-impact**.  
- For **fast, low-disruption installs**, or tricky substrates, **good engineered flooring** can be the pragmatic choice.

## Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for long-lived projects:**
  - **Solid hardwood flooring**, especially when:
    - Humidity is controlled
    - Structure is stable
    - A “forever floor” is part of the design intent.
- **When engineered is the better fit:**
  - Over radiant slabs
  - In basements (where allowed)
  - When wide planks and fast installation are priorities
  - When budget or schedule favors factory-finished products.

**Design guidance:**
- If choosing engineered, favor:
  - **Thicker wear layers**
  - Certified low-VOC adhesives
  - Responsibly sourced cores.
- If choosing solid, detail for:
  - Seasonal movement (gaps vs cupping)
  - Humidity management
  - Future sanding cycles.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If the building is meant to outlast you, solid wood is the floor. If the structure or schedule is tricky, choose a high-quality engineered plank—and know how many lives it really has.*
