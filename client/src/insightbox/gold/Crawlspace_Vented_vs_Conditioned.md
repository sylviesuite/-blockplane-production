## InsightBox — Crawlspace: Vented vs Conditioned

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two common crawlspace strategies:
- **Vented crawlspaces** (open to exterior air)
- **Conditioned crawlspaces** (sealed and connected to the building envelope)

Both approaches are widely used, but they perform very differently in terms of moisture control, energy use, and long-term durability.

**Core idea:**  
Crawlspaces behave more like basements than attics — moisture control matters more than ventilation.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Vented crawlspaces**
- Lower upfront cost
- Exposed to outdoor humidity and temperature swings
- Often increase heating and cooling loads

**Conditioned crawlspaces**
- Higher upfront investment
- Reduced heat loss through the floor
- More stable temperature and humidity conditions

**Energy performance**
- Vented crawlspaces can undermine insulation performance
- Conditioned crawlspaces reduce infiltration and energy loss

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Conditioned crawlspaces typically deliver **lower energy use and more predictable performance** over the building's lifespan.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture control**
- Vented crawlspaces often accumulate moisture, especially in humid or mixed climates
- Conditioned crawlspaces maintain controlled humidity, reducing mold risk

**Indoor air quality**
- Crawlspace air often migrates upward into living spaces
- Conditioning and sealing improves overall indoor air quality

**Durability**
- Conditioned crawlspaces protect framing, ducts, and plumbing
- Reduced corrosion, rot, and pest attraction

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Conditioned crawlspaces support healthier, longer-lasting buildings.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Vented crawlspaces are cheaper to build
- Conditioned crawlspaces add air sealing, insulation, and a small amount of conditioning

**Operating cost**
- Vented crawlspaces increase HVAC load
- Conditioned crawlspaces often reduce overall energy demand

**Risk cost**
- Moisture-related repairs in vented crawlspaces are common and costly
- Conditioned crawlspaces reduce long-term risk and maintenance

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Conditioned crawlspaces usually offer **better cost-per-impact** when moisture risk is considered.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Vented crawlspaces**
  - Lower first cost
  - High moisture risk in many climates
  - Often undermine energy and comfort goals

- **Conditioned crawlspaces**
  - Higher upfront investment
  - Better moisture, energy, and air quality control
  - Align with high-performance building practices

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *If it's under the house, bring it inside the envelope.*
