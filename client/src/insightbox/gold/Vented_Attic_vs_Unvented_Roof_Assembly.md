## InsightBox — Vented Attic vs Unvented Roof Assembly

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two common approaches to roof insulation and moisture control:
- **Vented attics** (insulation at the ceiling plane)
- **Unvented roof assemblies** (insulation at the roof deck)

Both can perform well when detailed correctly, but they differ significantly in lifecycle impact, risk profile, and suitability by climate and use case.

**The core tradeoff**
- Vented attics prioritize **simplicity and drying potential**
- Unvented roofs prioritize **thermal continuity and conditioned space efficiency**

---

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Material intensity**
- Vented attics typically use loose-fill or batt insulation with lower embodied energy.
- Unvented roofs often rely on spray foam or rigid foam, increasing embodied carbon.

**Construction complexity**
- Vented attics are simpler to build and inspect.
- Unvented assemblies require tighter tolerances and careful sequencing.

**Durability**
- Vented systems tolerate minor air leaks and moisture events better.
- Unvented systems concentrate risk at the roof deck if detailing fails.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Vented attics usually deliver **lower embodied impact and lower failure risk** per square foot.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture resilience**
- Venting allows assemblies to dry naturally.
- Unvented roofs depend heavily on perfect air and vapor control.

**Thermal performance**
- Unvented roofs reduce duct losses when HVAC is in conditioned space.
- Vented attics may require additional detailing to protect ducts and air handlers.

**Repairability**
- Vented systems are easier to modify or repair over time.
- Unvented assemblies are harder to access and correct once closed in.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Vented attics are more **forgiving and adaptable**, while unvented roofs demand precision.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Vented attics are typically the least expensive option.
- Unvented roofs carry higher material and labor costs.

**Operational value**
- Unvented assemblies can reduce energy loss in certain layouts.
- Vented attics often deliver similar real-world performance at lower cost.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Vented attics usually offer the **best cost-per-impact** unless design constraints justify unvented construction.

---

### Summary Takeaway

- Use **vented attics** for most residential buildings where simplicity and durability matter.
- Use **unvented roof assemblies** when design requires conditioned attic space or complex roof geometry.
- Climate, detailing skill, and inspection rigor should drive the choice.

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Vent when you can. Seal perfectly when you can't.*
