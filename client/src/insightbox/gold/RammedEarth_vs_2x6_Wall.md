# Gold InsightBox — Rammed Earth / Hempcrete vs. 2×6 Stud Wall

## Summary Takeaway

Rammed earth or hempcrete infill assemblies deliver regenerated mass-wall performance: high RIS, strong thermal mass, and very low lifecycle carbon when sourced from verified regional soils or hemp farms. The conventional 2×6 SPF stud wall with fiberglass batt insulation remains the baseline for predictable schedule, code familiarity, and lower up-front labor intensity; its higher LIS and embodied carbon reflect manufactured materials and fossil-fuel-based insulation. Use the earth-based assembly when your project budget can absorb slightly longer cycle times and you can control quality-sensitive batching; default to the 2×6 stud wall when tight schedule, standardized labor, or jurisdictional approvals outweigh the marginal carbon penalty.

## Lifecycle Impact

### Rammed Earth + Hempcrete Wall Assembly
- **Materials**: Local soils, lime or minimal cement binder, and hemp-lime infill deliver very low embodied energy; chloride-free lime and high-RIS hempcrete can still be sourced within 150 miles of most North American markets, dramatically cutting transport emissions. Avoid lime with high Portland-cement content to keep LIS low (<45) and to preserve vapor openness.
- **Transport**: Earth and hemp are bulkier but sourced locally; trucks can be staged on-site using staged batching to keep return trips under 30 miles per haul. Transport CO₂ is typically <5 kg CO₂e/m² because the material is dense but mined nearby.
- **Construction**: These assemblies rely more on manual batching, formwork, and longer cure times. Expect 2–3× the crew hours per m² compared to a stud wall, especially if onsite casting is used instead of pre-fab rammed earth panels. Proper moisture control and skilled tamping are essential; otherwise, the carbon savings are diluted by rework.
- **Longevity**: When detailed with sacrificial plasters and drainage, rammed earth/hempcrete resiliency rivals 2×6 walls, and lower material off-gassing keeps long-term indoor air quality favorable. Species-specific maintenance windows (lime washes every 7–10 years) are the main upkeep cost.

### 2×6 SPF Stud Wall with Fiberglass Batts
- **Materials**: Machine-milled SPF studs, OSB sheathing, and fiberglass batts carry a higher embodied energy profile. LIS routinely sits between 70–85 because of energy-intensive sawing, resin for adhesives, and petrochemical insulation. PMI-rated studs and recycled-content batt options can shave a few points but not enough to match earthen assemblies.
- **Transport**: Manufactured components travel through longer supply chains; expect 10–20 kg CO₂e/m² from trucking from regional mills. However, the predictability of deliveries keeps scheduling tight.
- **Construction**: Framing crews can install an entire exterior wall in one day. Drywall, sheathing, and insulation trades are standardized, so labor turnover or subcontractor hiccups are rare. This speed offsets some lifecycle penalties when schedule pressure is the dominant risk.
- **Longevity**: Properly detailed, 2×6 walls are resilient for 70+ years; however, moisture intrusion or fire events can trigger larger repairs. Fiberglass batts also compress over time, reducing thermal performance unless densely packed.

## Carbon + Energy Tradeoffs

- **Embodied carbon**: Rammed earth/hempcrete sits near 10–20 kg CO₂e/m² provided you keep cement additives below 10 % of binder mass and limit transport distances. The 2×6 stud wall ranges 25–35 kg CO₂e/m² for a baseline assembly; using mineral wool or recycled-content fiberglass can reduce ~3–5 kg CO₂e/m² but at higher cost.
- **Operational energy**: The high thermal mass of rammed earth can shave ~5–10 % from heating loads in temperate climates when combined with solar gain, but it is neutral or even slightly negative in humid tropical zones where night cooling is dominant. The stud wall’s fiberglass insulation keeps insulation R-value high, but over-time settling can create cold spots unless carefully installed.
- **Uncertainties**: Regional carbon intensity of power grids and cement producers can swing the gap by ±5 kg CO₂e/m². Hempcrete still requires reliable supply chains—if the farm is distant, transport emissions grow, and if the lime binder includes fly ash, the carbon profile may degrade.

## Cost and Constructability Caveats

- **Rammed Earth + Hempcrete**: Up-front material cost is comparable or slightly higher than standard walls once you account for the need for formwork, tamping tools, and skilled crews. Labor is the biggest driver; budget 15–25 % more time than a stud wall unless you are working with precast panels. Insurance and code review time can stretch longer in jurisdictions unfamiliar with earth systems.
- **2×6 Stud Wall**: Materials are easy to price, and crews execute quickly. The cost advantage is most pronounced in large-volume production builds, where framing crews run at peak efficiency. Watch for volatility in lumber and fiberglass batt markets, which can flip pricing quickly (e.g., SPF futures swings 10–15 % year over year).

## When Each Option Wins

- **Choose Rammed Earth / Hempcrete When**:
  * Your project sits within 120–150 miles of a verified soil/hemp supplier.
  * You can plan for longer cycle times and have craftsmen rated for tamping/infills.
  * Carbon reduction targets exceed 30 % below baseline, and you can capture the savings to investors or occupants (e.g., in regenerative housing pilots).
  * You prioritize indoor air quality and material permanence over finishing speed.

- **Choose the 2×6 Stud Wall When**:
  * Schedule is constrained and trades are difficult to upskill for earth systems.
  * Standardized, modular construction is necessary (e.g., in high-volume multifamily or retrofit tight sites).
  * Local codes require factory-graded assembly documentation that earth systems struggle to supply today.
  * The brief prioritizes cost predictability and supply-chain certainty, even if your embodied carbon budget is higher.
