## InsightBox — Cold-Climate Roof Failures: Ice Dams & Condensation

### At a glance

This InsightBox explains **why roofs fail in cold and mixed climates**, focusing on **ice dams and hidden condensation** — and how to prevent them with enclosure-first thinking.

Most roof failures blamed on materials are actually caused by **air leakage and insulation discontinuities**, especially near the eaves.

## Ice Dams: What Actually Causes Them

### The real mechanism

Ice dams form when:
1. Heat leaks from the house into the roof assembly.
2. Snow melts on the upper roof surface.
3. Meltwater refreezes at colder eaves.
4. Water backs up under shingles.

**Key point:**  
Ice dams are caused by **heat loss**, not by snow alone.

---

### Common contributors

- Thin or missing insulation at the eaves.
- Air leaks at:
  - Top plates
  - Attic hatches
  - Recessed lights.
- Ducts or air handlers in vented attics.
- Inconsistent air barrier continuity.

---

## Condensation: The Invisible Failure

### How condensation happens

Warm, moist interior air:
- Leaks into cold roof assemblies.
- Reaches surfaces below the dew point.
- Condenses inside insulation or on sheathing.

This can lead to:
- Mold
- Rot
- Loss of insulation performance
- Structural damage over time.

---

### Why it’s hard to detect

- Happens inside sealed assemblies.
- Often progresses for years before symptoms appear.
- Damage may not be visible until major repairs are needed.

## Vented vs Unvented Roofs in Cold Climates

### Vented Roof Assemblies

**Strengths**
- Vent channels help remove:
  - Heat
  - Moisture.
- More forgiving of small air leaks.

**Critical requirements**
- Continuous soffit-to-ridge venting.
- Full-depth insulation over exterior walls.
- Tight air barrier at the ceiling plane.

---

### Unvented Roof Assemblies

**Strengths**
- Works well with complex rooflines.
- Keeps ducts inside conditioned space.

**Critical requirements**
- Excellent air sealing at the roof deck.
- Proper insulation ratios:
  - Enough exterior or high-R insulation to keep sheathing warm.
- No casual mixing of vapor strategies.

---

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

- Roof failures drive:
  - Premature reroofing
  - Structural repairs
  - Interior damage.
- Preventing moisture failures:
  - Extends roof service life.
  - Preserves insulation performance.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Preventing ice dams and condensation often delivers **greater lifecycle benefit than increasing insulation thickness**.

---

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

- Dry assemblies:
  - Last longer
  - Use fewer replacement materials
  - Support healthier indoor environments.
- Moisture-safe roofs:
  - Improve resilience against climate extremes.

**RIS verdict:**  
Moisture control is foundational to regenerative performance in cold climates.

---

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- Better air sealing at ceilings and eaves.
- Raised-heel trusses or equivalent detailing.
- Thoughtful duct placement.

### Lifetime value

- Fewer roof and ceiling repairs.
- Lower heating demand.
- Reduced risk of catastrophic failure.

**CPI verdict:**  
Ice-dam prevention and condensation control deliver **exceptional cost-per-impact** — often paying back many times over.

---

## Summary Takeaway

- **Ice dams are a symptom, not a cause.**
- **Air leaks and thin insulation create roof failures.**
- **Best prevention strategies:**
  - Continuous air barrier at the ceiling or roof deck.
  - Full-depth insulation at eaves.
  - Keep ducts inside the conditioned envelope.
  - Use venting or insulation ratios correctly for the chosen roof type.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If warm air can reach the roof deck in winter, moisture will follow. Stop the air, and the roof problems stop too.*
