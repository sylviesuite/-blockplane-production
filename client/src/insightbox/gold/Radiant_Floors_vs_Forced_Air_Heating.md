## InsightBox — Radiant Floors vs Forced-Air Heating

### At a glance

This comparison looks at radiant floor heating versus forced-air heating systems.

Both can be paired with high-efficiency heat sources, but they deliver comfort in fundamentally different ways.

**Core idea:**  
Radiant heats people and surfaces. Forced air heats air — then hopes it stays put.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Radiant floor systems**
- Higher material intensity (tubing, plates, slab integration)
- Long service life when embedded correctly
- Lower operating energy due to low water temperatures

**Forced-air systems**
- Lower upfront material footprint
- Ongoing losses from ducts, leakage, and pressure imbalance
- Shorter equipment lifespan (blowers, dampers)

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Radiant has higher upfront impact but often lower lifetime energy demand.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Comfort quality**
- Radiant delivers even, draft-free comfort
- Forced air creates temperature swings and stratification

**Envelope interaction**
- Radiant pairs exceptionally well with airtight, well-insulated envelopes
- Forced air can undermine envelope performance through pressure imbalances

**Health & air quality**
- Radiant avoids dust circulation
- Forced air can distribute particulates if filtration is poor

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Radiant systems reinforce good building physics rather than fighting them.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Radiant floors cost more to install, especially in retrofits
- Forced air is cheaper and faster to deploy

**Operating cost**
- Radiant systems run at lower temperatures and longer cycles
- Forced air relies on higher peak output and fan energy

**Best-fit cases**
- Radiant: new construction, slabs, high-performance homes
- Forced air: budget builds, cooling-dominant climates

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Radiant pays off when long-term comfort and efficiency matter.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Radiant floors**
  - Superior comfort
  - Quiet, even heat
  - Best in well-sealed homes

- **Forced-air heating**
  - Lower upfront cost
  - Faster response
  - Comfort depends heavily on duct quality

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *If you want people comfortable, heat surfaces — not just air.*
