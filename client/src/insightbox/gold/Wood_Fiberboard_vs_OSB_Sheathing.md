# Gold InsightBox — Wood Fiberboard vs OSB Sheathing

## InsightBox — High-Performance Windows vs Standard Double-Pane Windows

### At a glance
This comparison evaluates **wood fiberboard sheathing** against **oriented strand
board (OSB)**, two common exterior sheathing options used to provide structural
backing, air control, and weather resistance.

Both are widely available, but they differ in **moisture behavior, durability,
embodied impact, and system resilience**—especially in high-performance wall
assemblies.

---

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)
- **OSB sheathing** typically has:
  - Lower upfront cost and high structural capacity
  - Energy-intensive manufacturing with resins and binders
  - Vulnerability to swelling and degradation when repeatedly wetted
- **Wood fiberboard** generally shows:
  - Moderate embodied energy with bio-based inputs
  - Lower resin content
  - Improved tolerance for moisture cycling

Over a full lifecycle, fiberboard often maintains performance longer in assemblies
designed for drying, while OSB’s impact increases when replacement risk is factored in.

---

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)
- **Wood fiberboard** scores higher on RIS because it:
  - Uses renewable wood fibers
  - Supports vapor-open wall assemblies
  - Reduces risk of hidden moisture damage
- **OSB** performs well structurally but:
  - Relies on adhesive-heavy manufacturing
  - Performs best in tightly controlled, low-drying assemblies

RIS favors materials that support **forgiving, repairable building systems** over
those requiring perfect execution.

---

### Cost Per Impact (CPI)
- **OSB** remains cost-effective where:
  - Budgets are tight
  - Moisture exposure is well controlled
- **Wood fiberboard** often carries a price premium, but CPI improves when:
  - Reduced moisture risk lowers repair and replacement costs
  - Assemblies prioritize durability over lowest first cost

CPI depends heavily on climate, detailing quality, and expected exposure.

---

### Takeaway
If the goal is **low upfront cost and high structural strength**, OSB remains a
common and serviceable choice.

If the goal is **moisture resilience, vapor openness, and regenerative alignment**,
wood fiberboard offers advantages that support long-term wall durability.

BlockPlane reflects this by rewarding fiberboard sheathing for regenerative
performance while remaining transparent about cost and structural tradeoffs.

---

### Notes
- Structural requirements may limit fiberboard use in some applications.
- OSB performance improves significantly with robust water management.
- Scores reflect typical North American residential construction practices.
