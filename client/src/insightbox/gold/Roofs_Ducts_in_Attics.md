## InsightBox — Ducts in Attics: Vented vs Conditioned vs Avoided

### At a glance

This InsightBox looks at **where ducts and air handlers live relative to the roof and attic**, and why this decision can **erase or multiply the benefits of a good enclosure**.

Many homes with “high R-values” still perform poorly because **ducts are placed in the worst possible thermal environment**.

---

## Why Duct Location Matters

Ducts move:
- Heated air in winter
- Cooled air in summer

If ducts are outside the conditioned envelope, **every leak and temperature difference becomes an energy penalty** — and moisture problems often follow.

---

## Common Strategies Compared

### 1. Ducts in a Vented Attic (Worst Default)

**Typical condition**
- Attic is vented and outside the thermal envelope.
- Ducts run above ceiling insulation.

**Problems**
- Extreme temperatures:
  - Hot in summer
  - Cold in winter
- Even “sealed” ducts leak in practice.
- Heat loss/gain increases system runtime.

**Field reality:**  
One of the **largest hidden energy penalties** in residential construction.

---

### 2. Ducts in a Conditioned Attic

**Typical condition**
- Roof insulation moved to the roof deck.
- Attic brought inside the thermal envelope.
- Ducts now operate in conditioned space.

**Benefits**
- Dramatically reduced duct losses.
- Smaller HVAC systems often possible.
- Better comfort and temperature balance.

**Trade-offs**
- Higher enclosure cost at the roof.
- Requires:
  - Excellent air sealing
  - Proper roof insulation ratios.

**Field reality:**  
Very effective when unvented roofs are already justified by design.

### 3. Ducts in Interior Chases or Floors (Best Practice)

**Typical condition**
- Ducts routed:
  - Between floors
  - In dropped ceilings
  - In interior mechanical chases.
- Attic remains vented and simple.

**Benefits**
- Keeps ducts fully inside the conditioned envelope.
- Allows:
  - Simple vented attic
  - Lower roof complexity.
- Excellent energy performance.

**Challenges**
- Requires coordination during design.
- Needs early planning with framing and layout.

**Field reality:**  
The **highest performance, lowest risk** solution when planned early.

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

- Ducts outside the envelope:
  - Increase operational energy every year.
  - Increase HVAC wear and replacement frequency.
- Ducts inside the envelope:
  - Reduce energy demand permanently.
  - Improve real-world system efficiency.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Moving ducts inside often delivers **greater lifecycle benefit than adding insulation**.

---

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

- Reduced energy use:
  - Lowers long-term emissions.
  - Reduces peak demand stress.
- Simpler roof assemblies:
  - Improve durability and moisture safety.

**RIS verdict:**  
Interior duct strategies score higher on **resilience, durability, and operational efficiency**.

---

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Vented attic with attic ducts**
  - Lowest first cost
  - Highest long-term penalty.
- **Conditioned attic**
  - Higher enclosure cost
  - Lower mechanical losses.
- **Interior ducting**
  - Modest design coordination cost
  - Minimal added materials.

### Lifetime value

- Interior ducts:
  - Smaller HVAC equipment
  - Lower energy bills
  - Fewer comfort complaints.

**CPI verdict:**  
Interior duct strategies deliver **exceptional cost-per-impact**. Conditioning the attic can be justified when design demands it.

---

## Summary Takeaway

- **Avoid by default:**
  - Ducts in vented attics.
- **Best overall solution:**
  - Keep ducts **inside the conditioned envelope**.
- **Acceptable alternatives:**
  - Conditioned attics when roof form or design requires it.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Decide duct location early.
  - Let duct strategy drive roof and attic decisions—not the other way around.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If your ducts live in the attic, your insulation is working overtime to make up for it.*
