# Gold InsightBox — Dense-Pack Cellulose vs Fiberglass Batts

## Summary Takeaway

Dense-pack cellulose and fiberglass batts can both meet code-minimum R-values on paper, but they diverge once you factor in embodied carbon, installation quality, and reliable performance. Cellulose is usually lower carbon, excels at filling irregular cavities, and is less sensitive to misinstallation; fiberglass batts are familiar and low-cost per bag, yet any gaps or compression quietly erase the rated performance. In most whole-lifecycle scenarios, dense-pack cellulose wins both on LIS (impact) and on occupant comfort.

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS perspective)

### Embodied Carbon
- Cellulose is primarily recycled newsprint/paper blended with borate or ammonium sulfate treatments; embodied carbon is very low—often among the best-in-class of conventional insulations.
- Fiberglass batts require melting sand and recycled glass at high temperatures; embodied energy and carbon are significantly higher per unit of R even when recycled cullet is used.

### Transport & Density
- Cellulose is denser per R-value but ships compacted and is blown in on site, which keeps transport carbon manageable (typically <5 kg CO₂e/m² for regional suppliers).
- Fiberglass is mostly air in the bag, so even rail-shipped bulk packages carry more CO₂ per R because of larger volumes per unit of insulation.

### Net Effect
- Dense-pack cellulose typically delivers a materially lower LIS than fiberglass batts for the same target R-value because of lower manufacture impact and better delivery of rated performance on site.

## Real-World Performance

### Installation Sensitivity
- Cellulose (dense-pack) is blown under pressure, filling odd-shaped cavities, spaces around pipes, and corners without hand-cutting. This dramatically reduces voids and unintended convection channels.
- Fiberglass batts are sensitive to cutting, fitting, and compression; gaps, slumping, or stuffing around services can reduce actual R-value well below label, especially in retrofit or irregular cavities.

### Air Movement & Sound
- Dense-pack cellulose slows air movement within the cavity and offers excellent sound attenuation.
- Fiberglass is more prone to internal convection if air leaks exist, which worsens thermal performance and raises perceived drafts.

### Moisture Behavior
- Both materials rely on proper air/vapor detailing.
- Cellulose can buffer small moisture swings when assemblies are designed for drying, while fiberglass is moisture-neutral but can hide condensation when gaps exist.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS perspective)

### Feedstock & Circularity
- Cellulose uses recycled content and can sometimes be removed or down-cycled.
- Fiberglass batts are technically recyclable but rarely are; most end up in landfill.

### Indoor Air & Health
- Modern fiberglass is safer than older binders, but handling (dust) still requires PPE.
- Properly specified cellulose with reputable fire/mold treatments is considered safe for occupants.

### Resilience & Comfort
- Better cavity fill plus sound control and stable performance give cellulose an edge on perceived comfort, especially in older or irregular buildings.

## Cost & Constructability

### Material + Labor
- Fiberglass batts are cheaper per square foot and familiar to most crews.
- Dense-pack cellulose requires blowing equipment and trained installers, yet can be competitive on total installed cost—especially at scale or in retrofit work.

### Retrofit vs New Construction
- Cellulose shines in retrofits, dense-pack applications, and cavities full of services.
- Fiberglass batts remain common in simple, open stud bays and production framing where speed is prioritized.

## Decision Guidance

- **Choose Dense-Pack Cellulose when**:
  * Embodied carbon and recycled content matter.
  * Assemblies are irregular, existing, or full of services.
  * Comfort, sound, and real-world performance weigh as much as label R.
  * Trained installers and equipment are available.

- **Choose Fiberglass Batts when**:
  * Upfront material cost is the main constraint.
  * Framing is regular and simple.
  * Crews are already set up for rapid batt installs.
  * You can enforce strict installation QA to protect performance.

## BlockPlane Bottom Line

Dense-pack cellulose almost always beats fiberglass batts on LIS for the same nominal R-value. On RIS, cellulose benefits from recycled feedstock and better real-world performance—when installed correctly by a competent crew. Fiberglass can still be acceptable in low-risk, well-detailed assemblies but should not be treated as the default if climate goals are on the table.

## Notes & Uncertainty

- Regional manufacturing, blowing agents, and treatment chemistry can shift scores.
- Moisture safety needs assembly-level evaluation (sheathing type, climate, air/vapor control).
- Cost comparisons vary regionally; treat price as an input, not a constant.
