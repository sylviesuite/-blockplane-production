## InsightBox — Wood Fiberboard vs Rigid Foam

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **wood fiberboard insulation panels** versus **rigid foam insulation boards** (EPS, XPS, polyiso) when used as continuous exterior insulation or roof overlay.

Both strategies cut thermal bridging and boost R-value. The key differences show up in **embodied carbon, moisture behavior, fire performance, and end-of-life options**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied energy & carbon**

- **Wood Fiberboard**
  - Made from **wood chips and fibers**, often with recycled content.
  - Low to moderate manufacturing energy; can be produced with **biogenic energy**.
  - Functions as a **carbon store**, locking plant-based carbon in the assembly for decades.
- **Rigid Foam**
  - Petrochemical origin (EPS, XPS, polyiso).
  - Manufacturing energy and climate impact vary:
    - **EPS:** lower embodied energy, pentane blowing agent.
    - **XPS:** higher embodied energy with historically high-GWP blowing agents.
    - **Polyiso:** moderate embodied energy, but foil facers add complexity and impact.
  - Overall **higher carbon intensity per unit of R** than wood fiberboard.

**Transport & installation**

- Wood fiberboard is **bulkier and heavier** than foam for the same R-value.
- Both ship as rigid panels and install with similar fastener layouts.
- Cutting fiberboard creates **biodegradable dust**; foam creates persistent plastic waste.

**End of life**

- **Wood fiberboard** can be landfilled with relatively low impact and has potential for reuse or even energy recovery in some regions.
- **Rigid foam** is typically landfilled and often contaminated; large-scale recycling pathways are limited.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **Wood fiberboard is clearly lower-impact**, with biogenic carbon storage and less harmful end-of-life pathways than rigid foam.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & drying behavior**

- **Wood Fiberboard**
  - Vapor-open and **moisture-tolerant** when detailed correctly.
  - Allows assemblies to **dry outward**, reducing risk in mixed or cold climates.
  - Can help buffer humidity swings in vapor-open walls.
- **Rigid Foam**
  - Vapor resistance varies by type and thickness.
  - Can **impede drying** if paired with inward-vapor-closed assemblies.
  - Some foams (especially polyiso) lose R-value at colder temperatures.

**Fire safety & ecology**

- Wood fiberboard is combustible but can be protected with cladding and fire-rated detailing.
- Many products use **low-tox binders** and avoid halogenated flame retardants.
- Rigid foams are combustible and typically rely on **chemical flame retardants**; they may require additional fire barriers.

**Repairability & reversibility**

- Fiberboard panels are easier to **remove, rework, or replace** during future renovations.
- Rigid foam is often layered with tapes, adhesives, and complex transitions, making selective repairs harder.
- Fiberboard supports **bio-based, circular assemblies** when paired with wood cladding and vapor-open WRBs.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Wood fiberboard scores higher** on regenerative metrics: biogenic carbon, vapor-open drying, and compatibility with repairable, low-tox wall systems.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Rigid Foam**
  - Often lower material cost per unit R, especially EPS.
  - Widely available and familiar to most crews.
- **Wood Fiberboard**
  - Typically higher material cost and may require special-order supply chains.
  - Installation labor is similar but can be slightly slower due to weight and care at fasteners.

**Value over time**

- Fiberboard’s **moisture-buffering and drying** behavior can reduce long-term risk of hidden damage.
- In many climates, fiberboard plus a good air-sealing strategy delivers **comparable operational performance** with far less embodied impact.
- Foam can still be cost-effective where materials are cheap, climate is dry, and detailing is well controlled.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> **Rigid foam may win on lowest upfront dollars**, but **wood fiberboard often delivers better cost-per-impact** once carbon, moisture risk, and future flexibility are included.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for low-carbon envelopes:**
  - **Wood fiberboard** when you can source it and detail it correctly.
- **When rigid foam is justified:**
  - Projects with **tight budgets, dry climates, or extreme space constraints**, using **lower-impact foams (like EPS)** and careful vapor control.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Treat foam as a **targeted tool**, not a blanket solution.
  - When using fiberboard, commit to a **vapor-open, well-detailed assembly** with robust air-sealing.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you can build the wall with trees instead of tanks, choose the trees. Use foam only when you must.*
