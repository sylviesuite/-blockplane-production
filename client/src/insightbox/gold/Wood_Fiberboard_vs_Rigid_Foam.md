## InsightBox — Wood Fiberboard vs Rigid Foam

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two options for **continuous exterior insulation or roof overlay**:
- **Wood fiberboard** — wood chips and fibers, often recycled content; vapor-open; moisture-tolerant; biogenic carbon storage; low to moderate manufacturing energy
- **Rigid foam (EPS, XPS, polyiso)** — petrochemical; higher R per inch; vapor resistance varies; pentane or higher-GWP blowing agents; widely available

Both cut thermal bridging and boost R-value. Differences show up in **embodied carbon, moisture behavior, fire performance, and cost**.

**Core idea:**  
Wood fiberboard typically wins on **embodied carbon, biogenic storage, and vapor openness**; rigid foam wins on **first cost and R per inch**. Use fiberboard where carbon and drying matter; use foam when budget or thickness is tight.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied carbon & manufacturing**
- **Wood fiberboard** is made from **wood chips and fibers**, often with recycled content. **Low to moderate manufacturing energy**; can be produced with **biogenic energy**. Acts as a **carbon store**, locking plant-based carbon in the assembly for decades. No blowing agents.
- **Rigid foam** is **petrochemical** (EPS, XPS, polyiso). Manufacturing energy and impact vary: **EPS** has lower embodied energy and pentane blowing agent; **XPS** documented density ≈35 kg/m³ (30–45), λ ≈0.030 W/m·K (0.029–0.036), R-5 per inch (R-4.5–5.6), embodied energy ≈90 MJ/kg (80–100), historically high-GWP blowing agents; **polyiso** ~30 kg/m³, λ ~0.027 W/m·K, R ~6.5 per inch, embodied energy ~100 MJ/kg (~90–110). Overall **higher carbon intensity per unit of R** than wood fiberboard.

**Transport & end of life**
- Wood fiberboard is **bulkier and heavier** per unit R; both ship as panels and install with similar fastener layouts. Fiberboard cutting creates biodegradable dust; foam creates persistent plastic waste. **Fiberboard** can be landfilled with relatively low impact and has reuse or energy-recovery potential in some regions. **Rigid foam** is typically landfilled, often contaminated; recycling pathways are limited.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Wood fiberboard typically has **lower lifecycle impact** than rigid foam—biogenic carbon storage, lower manufacturing energy, and less harmful end-of-life. Foam remains an option when budget or R per inch dominate and carbon is secondary.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture buffering & vapor openness**
- **Wood fiberboard** is **vapor-open and moisture-tolerant** when detailed correctly; allows assemblies to **dry outward** and can **buffer humidity swings** in vapor-open walls, reducing risk in mixed or cold climates.
- **Rigid foam** vapor resistance varies by type and thickness; can **impede drying** if paired with inward-vapor-closed assemblies. Some foams (e.g. polyiso) lose R-value at colder temperatures.

**Durability & repairability**
- Fiberboard panels are easier to **remove, rework, or replace** during renovations; rigid foam is often layered with tapes, adhesives, and complex transitions, making selective repairs harder. Fiberboard supports **bio-based, circular assemblies** when paired with wood cladding and vapor-open WRBs.

**Fire & material health**
- Wood fiberboard is combustible but can be protected with cladding and fire-rated detailing; many products use **low-tox binders** and avoid halogenated flame retardants. Rigid foams are combustible and typically rely on **chemical flame retardants** and may require additional fire barriers.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Wood fiberboard often scores higher on **moisture buffering, vapor openness, drying resilience, and repairability**; it fits vapor-open, low-tox wall systems. Rigid foam is a better fit where **cost, R per inch, and code-familiar details** dominate and moisture/fire risk are managed.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- **Rigid foam** (especially EPS) is often **lower material cost per unit R** and is widely available and familiar to most crews.
- **Wood fiberboard** is typically **higher material cost** and may require special-order supply; installation labor is similar but can be slightly slower due to weight and care at fasteners.

**Return on investment**
- **Wood fiberboard** often **pays off** when carbon, moisture risk, and future flexibility are valued—moisture-buffering and drying can reduce long-term risk of hidden damage; in many climates it delivers comparable operational performance with far less embodied impact.
- **Rigid foam** can be **cost-effective** where materials are cheap, climate is dry, and detailing is well controlled; it wins on **lowest upfront dollars** when budget or thickness is tight.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Rigid foam often **wins on upfront cost and R per dollar**. Wood fiberboard often delivers **better cost-per-impact** when **carbon, moisture resilience, and future flexibility** are included.

### Performance notes

- **R per inch:** Rigid foam typically delivers **higher R per inch** (e.g. EPS ~R-4, XPS ~R-5, polyiso ~6.5); wood fiberboard is **moderate R per inch** and usually requires **greater thickness** for the same nominal R. Both support long service life when detailed correctly.
- **Moisture & drying:** **Wood fiberboard** is **vapor-open** and allows **outward drying**; it buffers moisture swings and reduces reliance on perfect interior vapor control. **Rigid foam** resists bulk water when kept dry but can impede drying; vapor control and drying paths must be designed explicitly.
- **Durability:** Fiberboard is more **reversible and repairable**; foam’s continuity depends on tapes and adhesives. Both need protection from prolonged wetting and appropriate fire detailing.

---

### Installation & risk

- **Wood fiberboard:** Heavier and bulkier per R; requires care at fasteners and continuity at joints. **Risks:** supply chain, lead times, crew familiarity—mitigate with early specification and vapor-open detailing. **Rigid foam:** Cuts easily; familiar to crews; needs continuous taping and flashing. **Risks:** vapor traps if mis-detailed, combustible—detail for fire and moisture. Both benefit from robust air-sealing and a clear vapor strategy.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Wood fiberboard**:
  - Prefer when **low-carbon envelopes, vapor openness, moisture resilience, or repairability** matter; use when you can source and detail it correctly
  - Biogenic carbon storage; vapor-open; moisture-tolerant; easier to rework or replace. Higher upfront cost; moderate R per inch; greater thickness for same R

- **Rigid foam (EPS, XPS, polyiso)**:
  - Use when **budget is tight, climate is dry, or thickness is constrained**; lower-impact foams (e.g. EPS) with careful vapor control can be justified
  - Lower upfront cost; higher R per inch; broad availability. Treat as a targeted tool; vapor and fire detailing required

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Build with wood fiber when carbon and drying matter. Use foam when budget or thickness leaves no better option.*
