## InsightBox — Triple-Pane vs Double-Pane Windows

### At a glance

Both window types can be "high performance," but they solve **different problems**.

- **Double-pane** = good baseline efficiency
- **Triple-pane** = comfort, resilience, and peak-load control

The question isn't *which is better* — it's *when does triple-pane earn its cost?*

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Double-pane windows**
- Lower embodied impact
- Adequate U-values for many climates
- Shorter manufacturing chain

**Triple-pane windows**
- Higher embodied energy (extra glass, gas, spacers)
- Much lower heat loss over time
- Reduced operational energy for the building's full lifespan

**Cold-climate effect**
- Heat loss reduction compounds every winter
- Longer heating seasons increase payoff

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Triple-pane windows trade higher upfront impact for lower lifetime energy loss — strongest in heating-dominated climates.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Thermal comfort**
- Triple-pane interior glass stays much warmer
- Reduced radiant discomfort near windows
- Less cold downdraft

**Resilience**
- Better performance during power outages
- Slower indoor temperature drop
- Supports smaller or simplified heating systems

**Noise & durability**
- Improved sound attenuation
- Lower condensation risk
- Longer functional comfort life

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Triple-pane improves *how the building feels*, not just how it performs on paper.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Triple-pane typically costs 20–40% more per unit
- Installation cost is nearly identical

**System savings**
- Smaller heating equipment possible
- Reduced perimeter heat loss
- Can eliminate supplemental perimeter heat in some designs

**Best ROI cases**
- Cold climates
- High window-to-wall ratios
- High comfort expectations
- Electrified heating systems

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Triple-pane often pays for itself indirectly through system downsizing and comfort gains.

---

### Summary Takeaway

- **Double-pane**
  - Best for mild climates
  - Budget-driven projects
  - Lower-performance envelopes

- **Triple-pane**
  - Best for cold or mixed climates
  - High-performance and comfort-focused builds
  - Electrified heating and resilience goals

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *In cold climates, triple-pane pays back in comfort and energy; in mild climates, double-pane is enough.*
