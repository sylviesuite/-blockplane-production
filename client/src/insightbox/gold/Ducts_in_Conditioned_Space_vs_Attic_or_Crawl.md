## InsightBox — Ducts in Conditioned Space vs Attic or Crawlspace

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **locating HVAC ducts inside the conditioned envelope** versus placing them in **unconditioned attics or crawlspaces**.

Both approaches are common. The differences show up in **energy loss, moisture risk, durability, and long-term performance drift**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Energy efficiency & losses**

- **Ducts in Conditioned Space**
  - Any heat loss or gain stays **inside the building envelope**.
  - Leakage does not directly increase heating or cooling demand.
- **Ducts in Attic or Crawlspace**
  - Duct losses occur **outside the thermal envelope**.
  - Leakage and conduction losses directly increase system runtime and energy use.
  - In cold climates, attic ducts can lose heat rapidly; in hot climates, they gain heat.

**Materials & complexity**

- Bringing ducts inside often requires:
  - Soffits, dropped ceilings, or floor trusses.
  - Slightly more framing coordination.
- Exterior duct runs may seem simpler but often require:
  - More insulation.
  - Air sealing.
  - Ongoing maintenance to control losses.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **Ducts in conditioned space reduce operational energy demand**, often outweighing the small increase in framing or coordination complexity.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & durability**

- **Conditioned-space ducts**
  - Reduced risk of condensation on ducts.
  - Lower chance of hidden mold growth inside duct insulation.
- **Attic or crawlspace ducts**
  - Cold ducts in humid air can condense moisture.
  - Leaky ducts can drive humid air into building assemblies, increasing moisture risk.

**System performance & longevity**

- Ducts inside the envelope:
  - Operate in milder temperatures.
  - Experience less thermal stress and longer service life.
- Exterior ducts:
  - Are exposed to temperature extremes.
  - More likely to see insulation degradation and seal failure over time.

**Adaptability**

- Interior ducts are easier to access for inspection and future modification.
- Exterior ducts are harder to inspect and often ignored until problems appear.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Ducts in conditioned space score higher** for resilience, moisture safety, and long-term system reliability.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Conditioned-space ducts**
  - May add modest design and framing cost.
  - Often offset by shorter duct runs and smaller equipment sizing.
- **Attic or crawlspace ducts**
  - Lower perceived upfront cost.
  - Higher insulation and sealing requirements.

**Value over time**

- Conditioned ducts:
  - Lower energy bills.
  - Reduced comfort complaints.
  - Less risk of moisture-related repairs.
- Exterior ducts:
  - Often lead to higher operating costs and harder-to-diagnose comfort issues.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> **Ducts in conditioned space deliver superior cost-per-impact**, reducing energy use and maintenance risk for the life of the building.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for high-performance buildings:**
  - **Ducts fully inside the conditioned envelope**.
- **When attic or crawlspace ducts are unavoidable:**
  - Keep runs short.
  - Insulate generously.
  - Air-seal aggressively.
  - Minimize joints and penetrations.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Plan duct location early—mechanical layout is an **architectural decision**, not an afterthought.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you wouldn’t put your refrigerator in the attic, don’t put your ducts there either.*
