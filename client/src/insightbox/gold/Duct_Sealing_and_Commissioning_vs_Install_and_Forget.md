## InsightBox — Duct Sealing & Commissioning vs Install-and-Forget

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two approaches to ducted HVAC:
- **Sealed and commissioned ducts** (tested leakage, balanced airflow, documented performance)
- **Install and forget** (no leakage test, no balance verification, hope for the best)

Both deliver air to rooms; only one delivers the design.

**Core idea:**  
Duct leakage and imbalance can erase 20–30% of delivered capacity. Sealing and commissioning turn installed ductwork into a real system.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Unsealed / uncommissioned ducts**
- Leakage increases runtime and energy use for the life of the system
- Imbalance causes hot and cold spots, leading to thermostat overrides and more runtime
- No baseline document for future troubleshooting or retrofit

**Sealed and commissioned ducts**
- Lower operating energy and better delivered capacity
- Balanced airflow improves comfort and reduces callbacks
- Test results (e.g., CFM25, flow at registers) become the performance baseline

**Material and labor**
- Sealing adds labor (mastic, tape, inspection) and sometimes modest material
- Commissioning adds design and test time
- Both reduce long-term waste and rework

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Duct sealing and commissioning increase upfront effort but reduce lifecycle energy and improve real-world performance.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Comfort**
- Balanced systems deliver even temperatures and predictable response
- Leaky, unbalanced systems create complaints and over-conditioning in some zones

**Indoor air quality**
- Leaky return ducts in vented crawlspaces or attics can pull in contaminants
- Sealed ducts keep the air path under control

**Durability**
- Documented airflow and static pressure support maintenance and future changes
- “Install and forget” leaves no record when the system underperforms

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Sealed, commissioned duct systems support comfort, IAQ, and long-term accountability.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Sealing: labor and materials; cost varies with duct layout and access
- Commissioning: design and test time, possibly third-party verification
- Install-and-forget: no added cost, but hidden operating and comfort cost

**Operating cost**
- Leaky ducts increase heating and cooling load every year
- Commissioning often pays back in energy and fewer callbacks

**Best-fit cases**
- Sealing + commissioning: new construction, major retrofit, performance or comfort goals
- Install-and-forget: only when budget and scope explicitly exclude verification

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Duct sealing and commissioning usually deliver strong cost-per-impact where ducts are in unconditioned space or comfort is a priority.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Install-and-forget ducts**
  - Lowest first cost
  - Unknown leakage and balance
  - Higher operating cost and comfort risk

- **Sealed and commissioned ducts**
  - Higher upfront effort and cost
  - Known performance and a baseline for the future
  - Better energy and comfort over the life of the system

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *If you’re building ducts, seal them and test them. Otherwise you’re paying to condition air that never reaches the room.*
