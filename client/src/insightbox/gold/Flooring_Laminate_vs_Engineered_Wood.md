## InsightBox — Laminate vs Engineered Wood Flooring

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **laminate flooring** versus **engineered wood flooring**, two options that often compete directly on budget, appearance, and installation speed.

Both are layered products, but they differ significantly in **material composition, repairability, moisture behavior, and long-term value**.

---

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Laminate Flooring

- Core is typically **high-density fiberboard (HDF)** made from wood fibers and resins.
- Top layer is a **printed image** with a plastic wear layer.
- Manufacturing involves:
  - Resins and adhesives
  - Plastic overlays
- Limited repair options mean **shorter replacement cycles**.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Moderate embodied impact per square foot, but **higher lifecycle impact** when frequent replacement is factored in.

---

### Engineered Wood Flooring

- Thin hardwood veneer over **plywood or layered wood core**.
- Uses more processing and adhesives than solid wood, but:
  - Much less face hardwood per square foot
- Higher-quality products can be **refinished at least once**, sometimes more.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Lower lifecycle impact than laminate when the floor stays in place long enough to justify the added material quality.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Material honesty & aging

- **Laminate**
  - Appearance is printed; wear reveals core material.
  - Damage is usually permanent.
  - Visual aging is abrupt rather than gradual.
- **Engineered Wood**
  - Real wood surface develops patina.
  - Minor wear can be repaired or refinished depending on veneer thickness.

### Moisture behavior

- **Laminate**
  - Highly vulnerable to water at seams and edges.
  - Swelling usually requires full plank replacement.
- **Engineered Wood**
  - More stable than solid wood.
  - Still moisture-sensitive, but failures are often slower and more localized.

### Repair & adaptability

- Laminate:
  - Replacement-focused.
  - Difficult to patch invisibly once damaged.
- Engineered wood:
  - Better long-term adaptability.
  - Individual boards can sometimes be replaced; refinishing extends life.

**RIS verdict:**  
Engineered wood offers **higher regenerative potential** due to real material aging, repairability, and longer service life.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Laminate**
  - Generally lower material cost.
  - Fast, click-together installation.
- **Engineered Wood**
  - Higher upfront cost.
  - Installation ranges from click-lock to glue-down.

### Lifetime value

- **Laminate**
  - Typical lifespan: **10–20 years**.
  - Replacement often driven by damage or appearance wear.
- **Engineered Wood**
  - Lifespan: **20–40+ years** depending on veneer thickness and care.
  - Can survive remodel cycles.

**CPI verdict:**  
Laminate often wins on **first cost**. Engineered wood usually wins on **cost per year of service** when the building is expected to last.

## Summary Takeaway

- **Best choice for short-horizon or budget-driven projects:**
  - **Laminate flooring**, when:
    - Moisture risk is low
    - Replacement is expected and acceptable.
- **Best choice for long-term value:**
  - **Engineered wood flooring**, especially with:
    - Thicker wear layers
    - Verified low-VOC adhesives
    - Stable interior humidity.

**Design guidance:**
- Avoid treating laminate as “wood.”
- Specify engineered wood intentionally when longevity and material authenticity matter.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Laminate is a finish with an expiration date. Engineered wood is a thinner version of a real floor — and it ages like one.*
