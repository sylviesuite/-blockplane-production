## InsightBox — Integrated DHW & Space Heating vs Separate Systems

### At a glance

This comparison looks at how domestic hot water and space heating are provided:
- **Integrated systems** (one or two heat sources serving both DHW and space heat — e.g., combi boiler, heat pump with DHW module, or shared heat pump)
- **Separate systems** (dedicated water heater and separate space-heating system)

Both can deliver hot water and a warm house; integration affects efficiency, complexity, and first cost.

**Core idea:**  
Integration can reduce equipment count and improve part-load performance. Separation can simplify replacement and isolate failure. The best choice depends on fuel, layout, and client behavior.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Separate systems**
- Water heater (e.g., HPWH, gas tank, or tankless) plus space heating (e.g., heat pump, furnace, or boiler)
- Each unit has its own embodied impact and efficiency
- Failure or replacement of one does not force change of the other

**Integrated systems**
- One heat source (or a primary source with a DHW side) serves both loads
- Can reduce total equipment and sometimes improve part-load utilization
- Failure or replacement of the integrated unit affects both DHW and space heat

**Efficiency**
- Heat pump combi or heat-pump-plus-DHW can use one high-efficiency machine for both
- Separate HPWH + heat pump can also be efficient but with two refrigerant circuits and two controls

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Integrated systems can lower embodied and operating impact when well matched to the load; separate systems offer simplicity and independent replacement.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Electrification**
- Integrated heat-pump systems (space + DHW) support all-electric with one or two units
- Separate systems allow staged electrification (e.g., HPWH first, space heat later)

**Resilience**
- Integrated: one failure affects both hot water and heating
- Separate: DHW and space heat can fail and be repaired independently

**Maintenance and upgrades**
- Separate systems are familiar to most contractors; replacement is straightforward
- Integrated systems may require specialists and more careful sizing for both loads

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Integration can support electrification and efficiency; separation supports resilience and simple replacement. Match the choice to client and project.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Integrated: one or two units; can be higher or lower than two separate units depending on technology
- Separate: two units, two installs; often easier to bid and replace

**Operating cost**
- Integrated heat-pump systems can be very efficient if loads and controls are well matched
- Separate HPWH + heat pump also efficient; operating cost depends on usage and setpoints

**Best-fit cases**
- Integrated: new construction or major retrofit, all-electric goal, client wants fewer appliances
- Separate: phased upgrades, different replacement schedules, or preference for simple, independent systems

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Integrated systems can deliver strong cost-per-impact when both loads are sized and controlled together; separate systems win when flexibility and simplicity matter more.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Separate DHW and space heating**
  - Clear boundaries; replace one without touching the other
  - Familiar for contractors and owners
  - Two systems to maintain and potentially two fuels

- **Integrated DHW and space heating**
  - Fewer pieces of equipment; possible efficiency gain
  - Single point of failure for both functions
  - Best when design and sizing are done together

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Integrate when one heat source can do both jobs well and the client values simplicity. Separate when replacement timing or resilience matters more.*
