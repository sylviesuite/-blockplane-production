## InsightBox — Heated Slabs & Radiant Floors: Performance vs Risk

### At a glance

This InsightBox looks at **heated slabs and radiant floors** as they relate to **foundations and moisture**, not just comfort:

- Hydronic tubing in slabs (classic heated slab-on-grade)
- Hydronic or electric radiant above slabs or subfloors
- When it’s brilliant, and when it quietly creates problems

Radiant floors can deliver **superb comfort and efficiency**—or lock in **hard-to-fix issues** if moisture, flooring, and control are not respected.

## Types of Radiant Floor / Heated Slab Systems

### 1. Hydronic Tubing in Slab (Slab-on-Grade or Basement)

- PEX tubing embedded directly in concrete.
- Uses:
  - Boilers
  - Heat pumps
  - District heat or other low-temp sources.

**Strengths**
- High mass = steady, even heat.
- Can run at **low water temperatures**, great for efficiency.
- Very durable when done right.

**Risks**
- Slow response time.
- Embedded forever—hard/expensive to modify.
- Details below the slab (vapor, insulation) must be correct from day one.

---

### 2. Hydronic Overpour / Thin Slab Above Subfloor

- Tubing in a thin topping slab or lightweight overpour above a framed floor or existing slab.

**Strengths**
- Radiant comfort without fully redoing the structural slab.
- Can retrofit some existing buildings.

**Risks**
- Added weight on structure.
- More floor height build-up.
- Moisture-sensitive finishes must be carefully managed.

---

### 3. Electric Radiant Mats / Cables

- Electric resistance heating elements in:
  - Thinset
  - Self-leveling compounds
  - Under tile or certain approved finishes.

**Strengths**
- Great for **small zones** (baths, entries).
- Simple installation.
- Fast response compared to big hydronic slabs.

**Risks**
- Higher operating cost where electricity is expensive.
- Still sensitive to moisture and floor finish choice.
- Hard to repair once embedded.

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Operational impact

- **Hydronic radiant with efficient source (heat pump, condensing boiler):**
  - Very strong operational performance.
  - Works well with low water temps and good envelopes.

- **Electric radiant as primary heat:**
  - Can be high-operational-impact in many grids.
  - Better as **supplemental comfort** than sole heat source.

### Embodied impact

- Added materials:
  - Extra concrete or gypcrete
  - Tubing, manifolds, controls
  - Additional insulation to prevent downward losses.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Heated slabs can be **very LIS-friendly** when:
- Paired with low-carbon or efficient heat sources.
- Built over well-insulated, well-detailed foundations.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Comfort & health

- Radiant floors:
  - Reduce drafts and stratification.
  - Allow lower air temperatures for the same comfort.
  - Work well with quiet, low-speed ventilation.

### Durability & moisture

- **Key risk:** Heating a slab with **no proper vapor barrier or capillary break** can:
  - Increase vapor drive into the interior.
  - Drive moisture into flooring layers.
  - Lead to mold, curling, or adhesive failures.

- Finished flooring over radiant:
  - Wood, vinyl, carpet, and adhesives must be:
    - Rated for radiant
    - Compatible with higher surface temps
    - Able to handle slight cycling.

**RIS verdict:**  
Radiant floors score very high on comfort and long-term usability when the **foundation moisture details are solid**. They become risky when used over damp or marginal slabs.

---

## Performance vs Risk — Key Design Levers

### 1. Under-Slab & Edge Insulation

- Without adequate insulation:
  - A heated slab dumps energy into the ground.
  - Edge losses at the slab perimeter are especially severe.

**Best practice**
- Continuous insulation under the slab and at slab edges.
- Thermal isolation from footings where feasible and appropriate.

---

### 2. Vapor Barrier & Capillary Break (Non-Negotiable)

- Heated slabs *must* have:
  - Clean, washed gravel capillary break.
  - Robust, taped vapor barrier.
  - Sealed penetrations.

**Reason**
- Heat + moisture + slab = perfect conditions for:
  - Damp floors
  - Flooring failures
  - Odors and indoor air quality problems.

---

### 3. Controls & Zoning

- High-mass radiant (tubing in thick slabs):
  - Slow response—don’t over-zone tiny areas with tight setbacks.
  - Best with:
    - Steady setpoints
    - Outdoor reset controls
    - Simple, predictable schedules.

- Thin-slab or electric:
  - Faster response
  - More tolerant of setbacks and small zones.

**Rule:**  
Pick controls and zoning that match the **thermal mass** of the assembly.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- Hydronic slab systems:
  - Higher upfront:
    - Tubing, manifolds, pumps, mixing valves
    - Extra insulation and detailing.
- Electric mats:
  - Lower upfront in small areas.
  - Higher operational cost in many markets.

### Lifetime value

- Hydronic radiant with good envelope:
  - Excellent CPI:
    - Long system life
    - High comfort
    - Low operating cost.
- Electric radiant as primary:
  - CPI only pencils out in:
    - Very small areas
    - Short runtimes
    - Favorable electricity context.

**CPI verdict:**  
Heated slabs shine when they are:
- Part of a **whole-building efficiency strategy**
- Built on **well-insulated, well-protected foundations**
- Powered by **high-efficiency or low-carbon heat sources**

---

## Summary Takeaway

- **Best use of heated slabs / radiant floors:**
  - Hydronic systems in:
    - Well-insulated slabs and basements
    - High-performance envelopes
    - Buildings that benefit from steady, even heat.

- **Use electric radiant sparingly:**
  - As a comfort upgrade in:
    - Bathrooms
    - Entries
    - Small, specific zones.

- **Non-negotiable foundation details for radiant:**
  - Capillary break + robust vapor barrier.
  - Adequate under-slab and edge insulation.
  - Flooring assemblies rated for radiant.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Radiant floors feel forgiving, but the slab below isn’t. If the foundation isn’t dry and insulated, don’t use it as a radiator.*
