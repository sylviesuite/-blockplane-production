## InsightBox — Where to Spend the Next $1,000 in a Retrofit

### At a glance

This InsightBox answers a common, practical question:

> **“If I only have about $1,000 to improve this building, where does it actually make the biggest difference?”**

The goal is **maximum impact per dollar**, not perfection.

### Priority Order (Highest Impact First)

### 1. Air Sealing (Almost Always #1)

**Why it wins**
- Reduces heat loss, drafts, moisture movement, and comfort complaints.
- Improves the performance of *every* insulation and mechanical upgrade that follows.

**What $1,000 can buy**
- Sealing:
  - Rim joists
  - Top plates
  - Attic penetrations
  - Basement/crawl air leaks
- Gaskets at outlets and switches.
- Basic blower-door–guided sealing (if available).

> **Impact:**  
> Often the **best cost-per-impact upgrade in any climate**.

---

### 2. Attic Insulation (If It’s Thin or Missing)

**Why it’s powerful**
- Heat rises.
- Attics are easy to access and forgiving to upgrade.

**What $1,000 can buy**
- Blown-in cellulose or fiberglass to:
  - Top off under-insulated attics.
  - Improve comfort and reduce ice dams in cold climates.
- Best paired with **air sealing first**.

> **Impact:**  
> Large energy savings with low risk and simple installation.

---

### 3. Duct Sealing & Balancing (If You Have Ducts)

**Why it matters**
- Leaky ducts waste energy and create comfort problems.
- Duct leaks outside the envelope are especially costly.

**What $1,000 can buy**
- Mastic sealing of accessible duct joints.
- Sealing returns and plenums.
- Basic airflow balancing.

> **Impact:**  
> Improves comfort and reduces runtime without changing equipment.

---

### 4. Smart Controls & Small Electrical Upgrades

**Why it’s underrated**
- Cheap improvements that reduce wasted energy.
- Often improve usability and comfort immediately.

**What $1,000 can buy**
- Smart or programmable thermostat.
- Heat pump water heater controls or timers.
- Induction cooktop (portable) replacing gas for frequent use.
- Electrical prep for future electrification.

> **Impact:**  
> Modest energy savings plus **future-readiness**.

---

### 5. Spot Insulation Fixes (Not Full Walls)

**Why selective works**
- Full wall retrofits are expensive and disruptive.
- Small problem areas can punch above their weight.

**What $1,000 can buy**
- Dense-pack cellulose in:
  - Cantilevers
  - Knee walls
  - Bonus rooms
- Insulating and sealing attic kneewalls or garage-adjacent walls.

> **Impact:**  
> Fixes comfort complaints and reduces localized losses.

---

### What *Not* to Spend $1,000 On (Usually)

- New windows (too expensive per unit impact).
- Full wall insulation without air sealing.
- Fancy equipment upgrades without fixing the envelope.
- Solar PV in isolation (better saved for a larger, planned upgrade).

---

### Summary Takeaway

- **First dollar:** air sealing.
- **Second dollar:** attic insulation.
- **Third dollar:** ducts and controls.
- **Always:** fix the worst leaks and comfort problems before chasing shiny upgrades.

**Design guidance:**
- Retrofits work best as **layers**, not leaps.
- Each small upgrade should make the *next* one perform better.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you’ve got $1,000, don’t buy hardware. Buy tightness, insulation where it’s easy, and fixes for the worst leaks.*
