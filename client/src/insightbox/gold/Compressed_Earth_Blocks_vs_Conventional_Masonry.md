## InsightBox — Compressed Earth Blocks vs Conventional Masonry

### At a glance

**Compressed earth blocks (CEBs):** modular units from soil, stabilizer, and compression—no firing. Dry density ~1900 kg/m³, compressive strength ~3 MPa (typical range 2–4 MPa; code minimums near 2–2.5 MPa), thermal conductivity ~0.60 W/m·K, embodied energy ~750 MJ/m³ (~0.40 MJ/kg). **Conventional masonry (CMU):** normal-weight concrete block to ASTM C90. Density ~2300 kg/m³ (typical 2200–2400), compressive strength ~14 MPa (common 13–20 MPa, code minimums around 13–14 MPa), thermal conductivity ~1.2 W/m·K (dense block typically 1.1–1.3), embodied energy ~2300 MJ/m³ (1.0 MJ/kg). CEBs have much lower embodied energy than both CMU and fired clay brick (~3 MJ/kg, on the order of ~6000 MJ/m³ at ~2000 kg/m³); CMU is stronger than CEB but conducts more heat and is usually paired with insulation.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

CEBs avoid firing and heavy processing, so embodied energy is much lower: ~750 MJ/m³ vs ~2300 MJ/m³ for conventional masonry and ~6000 MJ/m³ for fired clay brick (~3 MJ/kg at ~2000 kg/m³). That difference flows through to lower embodied carbon when the energy mix is similar. Conventional masonry sits between CEB and fired brick on embodied energy; real LIS for both depends on transport, production, and (for CEB) stabilizer type.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

CEBs can use local soils and low-tech production, reducing transport and industrial processing; stabilizer choice affects performance and environmental profile. Conventional masonry relies on cement and aggregate supply chains but is familiar, durable, and widely specified. Documented values are conservative references until project- or manufacturer-specific data are available.

### Cost–Performance (CPI) & tradeoffs

**When conventional masonry (CMU) is the practical choice:** need for high compressive strength (~14 MPa), familiarity with codes and trades, durability in exposed or demanding applications, or where CEB supply or labour is limited. **When compressed earth might be better:** lower embodied carbon and embodied energy matter, soil and labour are available, and thermal performance can be detailed correctly (CEB’s lower λ helps, though both benefit from insulation strategy). Tradeoffs: CEB has lower strength (~3 MPa) so wall design and reinforcement must match; CMU has high thermal conductivity (~1.2 W/m·K) so insulation and detailing are critical. Both provide thermal mass; neither is an insulator by itself.

### What to watch (builder-practical)

- **CEB:** Confirm soil suitability and stabilizer type; check code minimums for compressive strength (often 2–2.5 MPa); plan thermal mass and insulation; source EPDs when available.
- **Conventional masonry:** Detail for moisture (flashings, weep holes, drainage); pair with insulation to offset high λ (~1.2 W/m·K); footing and structural design to match 13–14 MPa minimum and local practice.
- **Both:** Use documented densities and embodied energy as reference only until manufacturer- or project-specific data exist.
