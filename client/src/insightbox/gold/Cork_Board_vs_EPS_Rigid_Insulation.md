## InsightBox — Cork Board vs EPS Rigid Insulation

### At a glance
This comparison contrasts **cork board insulation** with **EPS rigid foam**, two options for exterior or under-slab thermal control that represent different sustainability priorities.

Cork board centers on bio-based inputs and moisture openness, while EPS leans on low cost, high R-value, and industry familiarity.

---

### Thermal performance & moisture behavior
- **EPS** delivers higher R-value per inch and resists bulk moisture when kept dry, but its vapor resistance and synthetic skin can trap incidental water if detailing is poor.
- **Cork board** has moderate R-value but stays vapor-open, tolerate moisture swings, and maintains performance without high thermal bridging.

Cork board also contributes acoustic damping, while EPS shines in compact, straightforward assemblies—especially below-grade or under slabs.

---

### Embodied carbon & material sourcing
- **EPS** is petroleum-derived and typically uses pentane blowing agents, giving it a moderate embodied carbon that remains competitive because of efficient manufacturing.
- **Cork** is 100% bio-based, often sourced from regional forestry by-products, and stores carbon for the life of the building.

While EPS remains cost-effective at scale, cork board is easier to reposition if assemblies change, and its clean chemistry simplifies renovation or demolition.

---

### Durability & end-of-life considerations
- **Cork** resists fire, molds slowly when kept dry, and can be recycled or safely landfilled with minimal off-gassing.
- **EPS** resists rot and pests but can melt or deform under heat, and recycling options remain limited; mechanical damage to panels also affects thermal continuity.

Both materials support long service life, but cork’s repairability and reusability push its regenerative score upward when assemblies stay dry and well-vented.

---

### Cost context & practical tradeoffs
- **EPS** remains the lowest-cost option upfront, with broad availability and easy handling for crews.
- **Cork board** costs more and requires care to avoid damage, but it reduces reliance on HVAC recapitalization, and its premium can be offset by improved resilience.

EPS works well when budgets are tight and assemblies stay dry; cork earns better CPI when moisture risk, fire safety, or occupant comfort dominate.

---

### Summary takeaway
Choose **EPS** when the priority is low first cost, high nominal R-value, and a well-understood installation workflow.

Choose **cork board** when moisture tolerance, carbon storage, and long-term adaptability are key—even if the initial material cost is higher.

BlockPlane awards cork more regenerative credit while still noting EPS’s practical strengths in typical North American projects.

## Summary Takeaway

Cork board and EPS both serve as exterior or under-slab insulation, but they sit on opposite ends of the sustainability spectrum. EPS optimizes for cost and availability, while cork optimizes for carbon storage, fire behavior, and end-of-life safety. For projects where ecological impact and material cleanliness matter, cork board often delivers qualitatively different value than foam.

## What’s Being Compared

### Cork Board Insulation

- Expanded cork granules pressed into rigid boards
- 100% bio-based, often sourced from forestry by-products
- Vapor-open, moisture-tolerant, and dimensionally stable
- Examples: Amorim boards used in European high-performance builds

### EPS (Expanded Polystyrene) Rigid Insulation

- Petroleum-derived beads expanded and fused into boards
- Commonly used under slabs and as exterior insulation
- Variants include Type I–II, geofoam, and drainage boards

## Lifecycle & Carbon Impact (LIS)

### Cork Board

- Bio-based and renewable feedstock
- Significant biogenic carbon storage
- Low toxicity and clean end-of-life options (reuse, energy recovery)

### EPS

- Fossil-derived polymer chemistry
- Moderate embodied carbon
- Limited and often contaminated recycling streams

### LIS Signal

Cork typically scores substantially better on lifecycle emissions, especially where carbon storage is valued.

## Regenerative & Resilience Considerations (RIS)

### Cork Board

- Naturally fire-resistant; chars rather than melts or drips
- Does not off-gas toxic smoke like many foams
- Vapor-open and able to buffer small moisture swings

### EPS

- Combustible; requires careful detailing in fire zones
- Can deform under high heat
- Limited moisture buffering; performance depends on keeping it dry

### RIS Signal

Cork board ranks higher for fire behavior, indoor air quality potential, and ecological alignment.

## Thermal Performance Reality

### Cork Board

- Moderate R-value per inch (similar to many natural insulations)
- Stable performance across time and temperature
- Functions as both insulation and acoustic layer

### EPS

- Higher R-value per inch than cork
- Thermal performance remains stable if kept dry and protected
- Well-characterized behavior in standard details

### Key Trade-off

EPS wins on pure R-per-dollar; cork wins on carbon, ecology, and multi-function.

## Moisture & Assembly Behavior

### Cork Board

- Vapor-open and moisture-tolerant
- Helps assemblies dry while still insulating
- Lower risk of trapped moisture compared to foam-first systems

### EPS

- Low water absorption but not immune
- Often paired with drainage or membrane layers
- Can slow drying if mis-detailed

## Cost & Constructability

### Cork Board

- Higher cost and less available in many North American markets
- Heavier boards but straightforward to handle
- Works well in EIFS, exterior insulation, and select under-slab applications

### EPS

- Low cost, ubiquitous supply
- Familiar to contractors
- Many code-listed products and details

## Failure Modes & Risk

### Cork Board

- Risk: sourcing, lead times, and crew familiarity
- Mitigation: early specification and clear installation guidance

### EPS

- Risk: pests, solvents, and damage in exposed areas
- Mitigation: protection layers and robust detailing

## Decision Guidance

- **Choose Cork Board if**:
  * Carbon and ecological impact are top priorities
  * Vapor-open, low-toxicity assemblies are desired
  * Higher upfront cost is acceptable for long-term alignment with regenerative goals

- **Choose EPS if**:
  * Budget and availability dominate
  * A widely understood, code-proven solution is needed
  * Moisture, pest, and protection detailing can be managed carefully

## BlockPlane Lens

In BlockPlane scoring, cork board tends to land in a High-RIS / Low-LIS tier, especially in deep sustainability projects. EPS typically scores Transitional—functional and affordable, but it needs strategic use to align with long-term carbon and material-health goals.
