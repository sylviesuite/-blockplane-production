## InsightBox — Cork Board vs EPS Rigid Insulation

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two options for **exterior or under-slab thermal control**:
- **Cork board** — expanded cork granules pressed into rigid boards; 100% bio-based; vapor-open; moisture-tolerant; moderate R-value per inch; fire-resistant; carbon storage
- **EPS (expanded polystyrene)** — petroleum-derived beads expanded and fused; pentane blowing agents; higher R-value per inch than cork; vapor-permeable when unfaced; low cost; industry-familiar

Both serve as exterior or under-slab insulation. Differences show up in **embodied carbon, vapor openness, moisture behavior, fire performance, and cost**.

**Core idea:**  
Cork typically wins on **renewable origin, carbon storage, vapor openness, and fire behavior**; EPS wins on **first cost and R per inch**. Use cork where ecology and moisture tolerance matter; use EPS when budget and nominal R dominate.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied carbon & sourcing**
- **Cork** is **100% bio-based**, often sourced from forestry by-products; it **stores biogenic carbon** for the life of the building. Low toxicity and clean end-of-life options (reuse, energy recovery). No blowing agents.
- **EPS** is **petroleum-derived**; beads expanded with **pentane** (moderate GWP). Manufacturing is efficient, so embodied carbon stays **moderate** versus other foams; recycling streams remain limited and often contaminated.

**Blowing agents & long-term impact**
- EPS relies on **pentane or CO₂**; gases either escape early with limited impact or stay locked—long-term carbon cost is smaller than XPS-style HFCs. Cork has **no blowing agents** and no long-term off-gassing from insulation chemistry.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Cork typically scores **substantially better on lifecycle emissions** where carbon storage and renewable origin are valued. EPS offers **moderate embodied carbon** and higher R per inch at lower cost; it remains a practical choice when budget and availability dominate.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture buffering & vapor openness**
- **Cork** is **vapor-open and moisture-tolerant**; it can **buffer small moisture swings** and let assemblies dry. Lower risk of trapped moisture compared to foam-first systems; dimensionally stable when kept in appropriate use.
- **EPS** has low water absorption when kept dry but is more vapor-resistant when faced; **mis-detailed assemblies** can slow drying. Performance depends on keeping it dry and protected; vapor-permeable when unfaced.

**Fire behavior**
- **Cork** is **naturally fire-resistant**; it chars rather than melts or drips and does not off-gas toxic smoke like many foams.
- **EPS** is **combustible**; it can deform under heat and typically requires careful detailing in fire zones and protection (e.g. thermal barrier) per code.

**Durability & end of life**
- Cork resists mold when kept dry, can be **recycled or safely landfilled** with minimal off-gassing, and is **easier to reposition or reuse** if assemblies change. EPS resists rot and pests but **recycling remains limited**; mechanical damage affects thermal continuity; panels are less easily reused.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Cork often ranks higher for **fire behavior, vapor openness, moisture buffering, and end-of-life alignment**. EPS is a better fit where **cost, R per inch, and code-familiar details** are priorities and moisture/fire risk are managed.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- **EPS** is typically the **lowest-cost option** upfront, with broad availability and easy handling for most crews; many code-listed products and details.
- **Cork board** **costs more** and can have **longer lead times** and less availability in some North American markets; it requires care to avoid damage during handling and install.

**Return on investment**
- Cork’s premium can **pay off** when carbon storage, moisture tolerance, fire safety, or occupant comfort are valued—and when resilience or reduced HVAC recapitalization is part of the equation.
- EPS **delivers better R-per-dollar** when budgets are tight and assemblies stay dry and well-detailed; it works well in compact, straightforward assemblies (e.g. below-grade, under slabs).

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> EPS usually **wins on upfront cost and R per dollar**. Cork often delivers **better cost-per-impact** when **ecological impact, moisture tolerance, fire safety, or long-term adaptability** are priorities and higher initial cost is acceptable.

### Performance notes

- **R-value per inch:** **EPS** typically delivers **higher R per inch** than cork. Cork has **moderate R-value per inch** (similar to many natural insulations); for the same nominal R, cork usually requires **greater thickness**. Both can support long service life when used within their limits.
- **Moisture & drying:** **Cork** is **vapor-open** and helps assemblies dry while insulating; it tolerates moisture swings and maintains performance without relying on perfect vapor control. **EPS** resists bulk moisture when kept dry but can trap incidental water if detailing is poor; vapor-permeable unfaced EPS can allow some drying.
- **Fire & durability:** Cork contributes **acoustic damping** and is **fire-resistant**; EPS is combustible and needs protection. Both support long life if kept dry and protected as required; cork’s repairability and reusability favor it in regenerative scoring.

### Installation & risk

- **Cork:** Heavier boards but straightforward to handle; works well in EIFS, exterior insulation, and select under-slab applications. **Risks:** sourcing, lead times, crew familiarity—mitigate with early specification and clear installation guidance.
- **EPS:** Familiar to contractors; cuts easily but can be crushed. **Risks:** pests, solvents, and damage in exposed areas—mitigate with protection layers and robust detailing. Both require appropriate adhesives and continuity at joints.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Cork board**:
  - Choose when **carbon storage, vapor openness, moisture tolerance, fire safety, or long-term adaptability** are priorities
  - 100% bio-based; vapor-open; moisture-tolerant; fire-resistant; cleaner end-of-life. Higher upfront cost; moderate R per inch; greater thickness for same R

- **EPS**:
  - Choose when **budget and availability dominate**, or when **higher R per inch** and a well-understood, code-proven workflow are needed
  - Lowest first cost; higher R per inch; broad supply. Moisture, pest, and protection detailing must be managed; combustible—detail for fire zones

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Cork buys carbon storage, vapor openness, and fire behavior. EPS buys R per dollar and familiarity—use it where that’s enough.*
