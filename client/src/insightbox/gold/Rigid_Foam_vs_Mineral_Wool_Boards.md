## InsightBox — Rigid Foam vs Mineral Wool Boards

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **rigid foam insulation boards** (EPS, XPS, polyiso) versus **mineral wool insulation boards** when used as continuous exterior insulation in wall and roof assemblies.

Both strategies improve thermal performance by reducing thermal bridging, but they differ significantly in **embodied carbon, moisture behavior, fire resistance, and long-term resilience**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied energy & carbon**

- **Rigid Foam**
  - Petrochemical-based insulation.
  - Manufacturing energy varies by type:
    - **EPS:** lower embodied energy, pentane blowing agent.
    - **XPS:** higher embodied energy; historically high-GWP blowing agents.
    - **Polyiso:** reference values density ~30 kg/m³ (range ~28–32), thermal conductivity ~0.027 W/m·K (~0.025–0.03), R-value ~6.5 per inch (~6–7); embodied energy ~100 MJ/kg (range ~90–110). Foil facers add complexity. R-value can drop at cold temperatures.
  - Overall **higher carbon intensity** than mineral wool.
- **Mineral Wool Boards**
  - Made from basalt rock or recycled steel slag.
  - High-temperature manufacturing → energy intensive.
  - Often incorporates recycled industrial byproducts, partially offsetting impact.

**Transport & installation**

- Both ship as rigid panels.
- Mineral wool boards are heavier and bulkier.
- Installation energy is low for both; fastening systems dominate on-site effort.

**End of life**

- Rigid foam boards are difficult to recycle and often contaminated at removal.
- Mineral wool boards are also typically landfilled but can sometimes be reused if removed intact.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **Mineral wool boards generally outperform rigid foam** on lifecycle impact, especially when XPS or foil-faced polyiso is used.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & drying behavior**

- **Rigid Foam**
  - Vapor resistance varies by type and thickness.
  - Can trap moisture if paired with inward-vapor-closed assemblies.
  - Some foams lose R-value in cold temperatures (polyiso).
- **Mineral Wool Boards**
  - Vapor-open and highly water-resistant.
  - Allow assemblies to **dry outward**, increasing resilience.
  - Maintain thermal performance across temperature swings.

**Fire safety & durability**

- Mineral wool is **non-combustible** and frequently used as a fire barrier.
- Rigid foams are combustible and require ignition barriers or coverings.
- Mineral wool boards resist compression and maintain thickness over time.

**Adaptability & repair**

- Mineral wool boards are easier to remove and replace during renovations.
- Rigid foams are often glued, taped, or layered into complex assemblies that are harder to modify later.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Mineral wool boards score higher** for fire safety, moisture resilience, and compatibility with repairable, long-lived wall systems.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Rigid Foam**
  - Often lower material cost, especially EPS.
  - Widely available and familiar to crews.
- **Mineral Wool Boards**
  - Higher material cost.
  - Fasteners and detailing can add labor time.

**Value over time**

- Mineral wool’s fire resistance and moisture tolerance reduce long-term risk.
- Rigid foam can still be cost-effective in climates where moisture risk is low and detailing is well controlled.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> **Rigid foam may win on upfront cost**, but **mineral wool boards often deliver better cost-per-impact** when resilience and fire performance are included.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Performance-forward assemblies:**
  - Mineral wool boards for vapor-open, fire-resilient, durable envelopes.
- **Cost-sensitive or space-limited designs:**
  - EPS or polyiso used carefully and sparingly.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Avoid blanket use of high-GWP foams.
  - Match insulation type to climate, drying strategy, and fire exposure.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Use mineral wool when you want resilience. Use foam when you truly need it — and choose the least harmful type.*
