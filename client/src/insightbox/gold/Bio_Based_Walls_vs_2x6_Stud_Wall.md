## InsightBox — Bio-Based Walls vs Code-Minimum 2×6 Stud Wall

### At a glance

This comparison looks at a family of **bio-based wall systems**—such as **straw bale, hempcrete infill, and wood-fiberboard exterior insulation**—versus a **code-minimum 2×6 stud wall with fiberglass batts**.

All can meet energy code. The differences show up in **carbon story, comfort and resilience, moisture behavior, and how much the wall depends on flawless control layers**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Bio-based wall families**

- **Straw bale walls**
  - Built from **agricultural byproduct** (straw) plus mineral or clay plasters.
  - Very low embodied energy and **significant biogenic carbon storage**.
- **Hempcrete infill walls**
  - Hemp hurd + lime binder around a frame.
  - Hemp sequesters CO₂; lime carries impact but can **re-carbonate over time**.
  - Often net very-low-carbon when mixes and sourcing are careful.
- **Wood fiberboard envelopes**
  - Panels made from wood chips/fibers, sometimes with recycled content.
  - Low to moderate embodied energy and **carbon stored in the board**.

**Code-minimum 2×6 fiberglass stud wall**

- Dimensional lumber + OSB/plywood + fiberglass batts + standard cladding.
- Fiberglass has **moderate embodied energy** and no carbon storage.
- Lumber stores some biogenic carbon, but total impact is pulled up by sheathing, finishes, and any foam layers.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> Across the family, **bio-based walls are consistently lower-impact—and often carbon-storing—compared to a conventional 2×6 fiberglass stud wall**, especially when materials are locally sourced.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & hygrothermal behavior**

- **Bio-based walls**
  - Straw, hempcrete, and wood fiberboard are generally:
    - **Vapor-open**
    - **Hygroscopic** (can absorb, redistribute, and release moisture)
  - When paired with breathable finishes and good bulk-water control, the **wall itself helps manage moisture and interior conditions**.
- **2×6 fiberglass wall**
  - Fiberglass does not buffer moisture.
  - Performance depends on **separate air and vapor control layers**.
  - Air leaks can move moisture into cold zones and cavities where damage can hide.

**Comfort, mass & experience**

- Bio-based walls:
  - Often thicker, with a mix of **insulation + thermal mass**.
  - Tend to produce **quieter, more stable interior conditions** and a “soft” comfort profile.
- 2×6 walls:
  - Light and thinner, reacting quickly to exterior swings.
  - Comfort depends more on HVAC and control-layer precision than the wall material itself.

**Durability & repair**

- Bio-based assemblies:
  - Can be very durable when kept dry and properly detailed.
  - Repairs are more specialized but walls are often **more tolerant of small moisture events**.
- 2×6 fiberglass assemblies:
  - Easy to open up and patch, but **easy to quietly degrade** over time with renovations and minor leaks that damage control layers.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Bio-based walls score higher on regenerative metrics**—carbon storage, moisture buffering, comfort, and long-term resilience—provided bulk water is managed and finishes remain vapor-open.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Bio-based walls**
  - Materials like straw, hemp hurd, and wood fiber can be inexpensive in raw form, but:
    - Labor, detailing, and training drive cost.
    - Wall thickness impacts foundations, framing details, and openings.
- **2×6 fiberglass wall**
  - The **commodity baseline**: cheap, fast, easy to permit.
  - Crews, inspectors, and suppliers already know it inside out.

**Value over time**

- Bio-based walls:
  - Offer **strong cost-per-impact** when you factor in:
    - Lower operational energy demand.
    - Reduced moisture and comfort risk.
    - Strong carbon story for certifications, policy, and marketing.
- 2×6 fiberglass:
  - Performs acceptably when **airtightness and vapor control are designed, tested, and preserved**.
  - More prone to quiet performance drift from small leaks and remodeling.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> On day-one dollars, **2×6 fiberglass is usually cheaper**. On **cost-per-impact across decades—carbon, comfort, resilience, and story—bio-based walls often deliver more value** in projects that can handle their thickness and craftsmanship.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for truly regenerative projects:**
  - **Bio-based wall assemblies** (straw bale, hempcrete, wood-fiberboard envelopes) with robust bulk-water detailing and vapor-open finishes.
- **Role of the 2×6 fiberglass wall:**
  - Treat it as a **code-minimum baseline**, not a target.
  - If you stay here, you must **upgrade the control layers** to approach the resilience of bio-based systems.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Use bio-based walls where you want the assembly itself to act as **insulation, carbon store, moisture buffer, and comfort engine**.
  - Use 2×6 fiberglass only when cost, familiarity, or schedule absolutely require it—and then invest the savings into airtightness and moisture safety.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If plants and minerals can do the job, start there. Use code-minimum 2×6 only as a baseline, not the benchmark.*
