## InsightBox — Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR)

### At a glance

Windows provide:
- Daylight
- Views
- Solar gain

But they also:
- Lose heat faster than walls
- Create comfort and glare issues
- Increase cost and system sizing

**Core question:**  
At what point does more glass stop improving performance?

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Walls**
- High thermal resistance
- Long service life
- Low operational energy loss

**Windows**
- Lower R-values (even high-performance units)
- Shorter replacement cycles
- Higher embodied impact per square foot

**Diminishing returns**
- Moving from 10% → 20% WWR often improves comfort and daylight
- Moving from 30% → 50% dramatically increases heat loss

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Beyond a modest percentage, windows increase energy demand faster than they improve livability.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Daylight & wellbeing**
- Moderate glazing improves circadian rhythm and comfort
- Excess glazing causes glare, overheating, and cold drafts

**Thermal comfort**
- Large window areas create radiant temperature imbalance
- Cold glass surfaces reduce perceived comfort even in heated rooms

**System stress**
- High WWR drives larger HVAC systems
- Increased mechanical complexity reduces resilience

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Human comfort peaks before glass area does.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Windows cost several times more per square foot than walls
- High-performance glazing increases cost rapidly

**Operational cost**
- Higher heating and cooling loads
- Increased peak demand

**Value per dollar**
- Strategic window placement beats large glass areas
- Orientation matters more than total glass quantity

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Fewer, better-placed windows outperform large expanses of glass.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Low WWR**
  - Best thermal performance
  - Lower system cost
  - Higher resilience

- **Moderate WWR (often ~20–30%)**
  - Optimal balance of light, comfort, and efficiency
  - Strongest overall performance

- **High WWR**
  - Comfort challenges
  - Energy penalties
  - Design-driven, not performance-driven

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Design windows for light and view, not square footage.*
