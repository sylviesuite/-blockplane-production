## InsightBox — Hempcrete vs Spray Foam Insulation

### At a glance
This comparison contrasts **hempcrete**, a bio-based insulation and infill material,
with **spray foam insulation**, a high-performance petrochemical product commonly
used to achieve airtight assemblies.

Both can deliver strong thermal results, but they differ sharply in **carbon
profile, durability assumptions, and long-term system behavior**.

---

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)
- **Spray foam insulation** provides high R-value per inch and excellent air
  sealing, often reducing operational energy demand early in a building’s life.
  Its lifecycle impact is driven by petrochemical feedstocks, energy-intensive
  manufacturing, and end-of-life disposal challenges.
- **Hempcrete** generally has a lower embodied energy profile and benefits from
  bio-based carbon storage in hemp fibers, moderate manufacturing energy, and
  compatibility with long-lived wall systems.

Across a full lifecycle, hempcrete often shows **lower cumulative impact** when
paired with durable structural assemblies.

---

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)
- **Hempcrete** scores higher on RIS due to renewable agricultural inputs, carbon
  sequestration during hemp growth, and vapor-open behavior that supports healthy,
  repairable wall assemblies.
- **Spray foam** performs well technically but relies on fossil-derived chemistry
  and assemblies that are difficult to modify or adapt over time.

RIS reflects the distinction between **regenerative material cycles** and
**extractive material systems**.

---

### Cost Per Impact (CPI)
- **Spray foam** often appears cost-effective due to fast installation, strong air
  sealing, and reduced detailing requirements.
- **Hempcrete** typically carries a higher upfront cost and longer installation
  time, but CPI improves when accounting for durability, moisture robustness, and
  reduced need for replacement insulation.

---

### Takeaway
If the primary goal is maximum R-value and airtightness in minimal space, spray
foam remains a practical option.

If the goal is carbon reduction, vapor-open durability, and regenerative material
cycles, hempcrete offers a fundamentally different approach aligned with long-term
environmental performance.

### Notes
- Spray foam climate impact varies significantly by formulation and blowing agent.
- Hempcrete performance depends on binder choice, mix ratios, and curing.
- Scores reflect typical North American materials and installation practices.
