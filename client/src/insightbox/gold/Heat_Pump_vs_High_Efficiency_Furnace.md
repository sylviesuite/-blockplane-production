## InsightBox — Heat Pump vs High-Efficiency Furnace

### At a glance

This comparison looks at modern cold-climate heat pumps versus high-efficiency gas furnaces.

Both can heat a home effectively, but they differ in operating cost, carbon impact, grid dependence, and future-proofing.

**Core idea:**  
Heat pumps reward good envelopes. Furnaces tolerate weak ones.

---

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Heat pump**
- Higher manufacturing impact due to electronics and refrigerants
- Very low operational emissions when paired with clean electricity
- Performance improves as grids decarbonize

**High-efficiency furnace**
- Lower manufacturing impact
- Ongoing combustion emissions
- Performance fixed over its lifetime

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Heat pumps win over time, especially in airtight, well-insulated homes.

---

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Resilience**
- Heat pumps pair well with solar and future grid upgrades
- Furnaces depend on gas infrastructure

**Indoor air quality**
- Heat pumps eliminate combustion indoors
- Furnaces require careful venting and maintenance

**Adaptability**
- Heat pumps support cooling and dehumidification
- Furnaces do not address summer comfort

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Heat pumps align better with long-term resilience and system integration.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Heat pumps cost more initially
- Furnaces are cheaper to install

**Operating cost**
- Heat pumps benefit from insulation and airtightness
- Furnaces are less sensitive to envelope quality

**Best-fit cases**
- Heat pump: tight envelope, long ownership horizon
- Furnace: leaky home, limited retrofit scope

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Heat pumps pay off when the building supports them.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Heat pump**
  - Best for efficient envelopes
  - Lower long-term carbon
  - Future-proof choice

- **High-efficiency furnace**
  - Lower upfront cost
  - More forgiving of poor envelopes
  - Higher long-term emissions

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Fix the envelope first — then choose the system.*
