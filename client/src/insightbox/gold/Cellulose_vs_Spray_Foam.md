## InsightBox — Cellulose vs Spray Foam Insulation

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **blown-in cellulose insulation** versus **spray polyurethane foam (SPF)** for typical wall and roof assemblies in residential construction.

Both can deliver strong thermal performance, but they differ dramatically in **embodied impact, chemistry, and retrofit behavior**. Cellulose leans toward low-carbon, low-toxicity, and easy deconstruction. Spray foam delivers air-sealing and high R per inch at the cost of **higher carbon, petrochemical inputs, and difficult end-of-life**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied energy & carbon**

- **Cellulose**
  - Primarily **recycled paper fiber** treated with borates.
  - Very low manufacturing energy; often produced regionally.
  - Acts as a **short-term carbon store**, locking biogenic carbon in the building for decades.
- **Spray Foam**
  - Petrochemical base (isocyanates + polyols) with blowing agents.
  - **High manufacturing energy** and chemistry with significant upstream emissions.
  - Certain blowing agents carry **very high global warming potential** if not carefully controlled.

**Transport & installation**

- **Cellulose** is light, ships compacted in bags, and is blown with electric or small engine machines.
- **Spray foam** uses chemical drums plus truck-mounted or trailer rigs, heated hoses, and compressors — **higher on-site energy and complexity**.

**End of life**

- **Cellulose** can often be vacuumed out and landfilled with relatively low impact or repurposed; it does not bond permanently to framing.
- **Spray foam** is **bonded to studs, sheathing, and wiring**, making selective demolition and material recovery very difficult. Typically becomes mixed construction waste.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> For whole-life impact, **cellulose is clearly lower-impact**. Spray foam only approaches parity if the project is extremely space-constrained and uses foam sparingly in targeted areas.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Material origins & chemistry**

- **Cellulose**
  - Utilizes **recycled newsprint/cardboard**, diverting waste streams.
  - Borate fire/bug treatment is low-toxicity when installed correctly.
  - Generally compatible with vapor-open, repairable wall systems.
- **Spray Foam**
  - **Petrochemical feedstock**, non-renewable.
  - Isocyanates can cause **sensitization and health concerns** for installers and improperly ventilated spaces.
  - Creates a hard-to-reverse assembly: wiring, plumbing, and future repairs are more intrusive.

**Moisture behavior & durability**

- **Cellulose**
  - Hygroscopic: can buffer some moisture and redistribute it, especially in vapor-open assemblies.
  - Requires good detailing to stay dry; wet cellulose must be allowed to dry or be replaced.
- **Spray foam**
  - Closed-cell foam resists bulk water and adds some structural rigidity.
  - However, foam can **hide moisture issues** in adjacent framing; rot can progress unseen behind an intact foam layer.

**Healthy buildings & flexibility**

- Cellulose aligns with **“repairable, reversible, breathable”** wall philosophies.
- Spray foam prioritizes **airtightness and maximum R-value**, sometimes at the expense of future adaptability and inspectability.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Cellulose scores higher** on regenerative metrics: recycled content, reversibility, and compatibility with low-tox, repairable assemblies. Spray foam’s RIS can be improved by limiting its use to small, targeted problem areas rather than blanket coverage.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Cellulose**
  - Typically **lower material cost per R-value**.
  - Installation cost is moderate; good fit for both new construction and retrofits.
- **Spray Foam**
  - **Higher installed cost per inch**, especially for closed-cell foam.
  - Requires specialized crews and equipment; mobilization has a cost even for small jobs.

**Energy savings & payback**

- Spray foam’s **air-sealing and higher R per inch** can reduce operating energy, especially in leaky or complex envelopes.
- Cellulose plus **dedicated air-sealing strategy (tapes, gaskets, airtight drywall, exterior WRB)** often achieves similar performance at **lower cost and impact**.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> For most standard walls and attics, **cellulose delivers better cost-per-unit-of-impact**. Spray foam can be financially justified at rim joists, tricky rooflines, or extreme space constraints, but is rarely the best value for large, simple cavities.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice:**  
  - For builders aiming at **low-carbon, repairable, and healthy assemblies**, **blown-in cellulose should be the starting point**.
- **When foam is justified:**
  - Small, targeted areas where **space is tight or air-leakage is hard to manage** (rim joists, complex roof junctions, retrofit air-sealing in inaccessible cavities).
- **Design guidance:**
  - Treat spray foam as a **surgical tool, not a blanket solution**.
  - Pair cellulose with robust air-sealing and smart vapor control to match performance while staying aligned with regenerative goals.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Use cellulose wherever you can, and foam only where you must.*
