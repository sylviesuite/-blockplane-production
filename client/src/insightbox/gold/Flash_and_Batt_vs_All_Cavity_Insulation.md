## InsightBox — Flash-and-Batt vs All-Cavity Insulation

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two common wall insulation approaches:
- **Flash-and-batt** — thin spray foam at sheathing plus fibrous insulation in the cavity
- **All-cavity** — full-depth cellulose, fiberglass, or mineral wool with a dedicated air barrier

Both control air leakage and condensation risk. Tradeoffs show up in **embodied impact, moisture safety, cost, and complexity**.

**Core idea:**  
Flash-and-batt uses foam for dew-point control; all-cavity relies on a continuous air barrier and vapor control. For most new construction, all-cavity is the default.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied impact**
- Flash-and-batt adds **spray foam** (high embodied carbon, especially closed-cell) on top of fibrous insulation.
- All-cavity uses only fibrous material: **cellulose** (lowest impact), **fiberglass** or **mineral wool** (moderate). No foam penalty.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> All-cavity typically has **lower lifecycle impact** than flash-and-batt; cellulose and other bio-based options are best.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & condensation**
- Flash-and-batt: foam moves the dew point and can protect sheathing when **thickness is right for the climate**; too-thin foam can trap moisture at the sheathing.
- All-cavity: relies on a **continuous air barrier** and vapor control; vapor-open assemblies allow drying. Sensitive to leaks if detailing is poor.

**Reversibility & repair**
- Flash-and-batt: foam is bonded to sheathing and framing; repairs and changes to wiring or plumbing are harder.
- All-cavity: fibrous insulation can be removed and replaced; assemblies stay **reversible and adaptable**.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> All-cavity often offers **better reversibility and long-term adaptability**. Flash-and-batt can perform well when foam is properly sized for the climate.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Flash-and-batt: spray foam mobilization plus batt adds cost; usually **more expensive** than a well-detailed all-cavity system.
- All-cavity: lower material and labor cost (especially cellulose or fiberglass); air barrier with membranes, tapes, or airtight drywall.

**Return on investment**
- For most new construction, all-cavity with a robust air barrier delivers **better cost-per-impact**.
- Flash-and-batt pays off in **retrofits** (limited exterior access) or **tight cavities** where foam at the sheathing is needed.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> All-cavity with a solid air barrier typically delivers **better cost-per-impact** for most projects. Use flash-and-batt only when the application justifies it.

### Performance notes

- Flash-and-batt: foam thickness must match climate; undersized foam can worsen condensation at the sheathing. All-cavity: performance depends on air barrier continuity and vapor control.

### Installation & risk

- Flash-and-batt needs qualified foam installers and strict sequencing (foam first, then batt); mistakes are hard to fix. All-cavity needs trained detailing at membranes, tapes, and penetrations.
- In both, verify air barrier continuity (e.g. blower door) before calling it done.

### Summary Takeaway

- **All-cavity**:
  - Default for new high-performance walls: cellulose, fiberglass, or mineral wool with a continuous, testable air barrier
  - Lower embodied impact, easier to repair, and usually better cost-per-impact
- **Flash-and-batt**:
  - Justified for **retrofits**, tight cavities, or dew-point situations where foam at the sheathing is needed
  - Size foam for the climate; keep air barrier continuity non-negotiable. Do not use as a generic upgrade.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Start with all-cavity and a great air barrier. Use flash-and-batt only when building physics truly requires it.*
