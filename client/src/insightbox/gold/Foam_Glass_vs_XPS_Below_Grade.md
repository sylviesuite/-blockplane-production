## InsightBox — Foam Glass vs XPS Below-Grade Insulation

### At a glance
Foam glass and XPS both target slabs, foundations, and other below-grade enclosures, but they occupy different parts of the risk curve. Foam glass brings inorganically stable, recycled glass with excellent moisture and load resistance; XPS delivers high compressive strength at lower cost but depends on blowing agents and is more sensitive to long-term gas diffusion. This comparison frames their lifecycle and performance trade-offs so builders understand when permanence matters and when a familiar, cost-effective foam is still fit for purpose.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)
- **Embodied energy & manufacturing intensity** – Foam glass requires significant heat to expand recycled cullet, yet its use of reclaimed glass keeps net embodied carbon modest compared to petrochemical foams. XPS relies on fossil feedstocks and energy-intensive extrusions; documented values for XPS: density ≈35 kg/m³ (30–45), λ ≈0.030 W/m·K, R-5 per inch, embodied energy ≈90 MJ/kg (80–100). Blowing agents add warming potential, which increases the initial LIS burden.
- **Transport weight & handling** – Foam glass is heavier and often shipped as modular blocks or gravel, which increases transport energy but helps stabilize the assembly. XPS is light and stacks compactly, simplifying logistics, though it can be vulnerable to shipping damage if not protected.
- **Durability in soil contact** – Foam glass is inert, resists microbial attack, and will not compress under loads, so its thermal properties stay stable for decades. XPS offers high compressive strength initially but can creep under sustained loads and loses gas over time, which reduces R-value in soil environments.
- **Expected service life** – Foam glass assemblies can last the life of the structure without needing replacement, while XPS may require careful detailing and periodic inspection to ensure performance doesn’t drift, especially when it serves as part of a permanent waterproofing assembly.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)
- **Moisture resistance** – Foam glass has a closed-cell, non-capillary structure so it repels water even when submerged, eliminating concerns over long-term saturation. XPS resists bulk water but can wick if damaged and is more susceptible to long-term moisture-driven degradation if vapor cannot escape.
- **Chemical stability & recyclability** – The inorganic chemistry of foam glass makes it inert to most soil chemistries and easier to recycle at the end of life. XPS degrades when exposed to certain solvents and relies on limited recycling streams for rigid foams, which keeps its RIS score lower.
- **Long-term carbon implications** – Foam glass locks carbon in recycled silicate, while XPS slowly loses insulating gas that eventually mixes with the atmosphere, raising the assembled system’s carbon impact over decades.
- **Below-grade failure modes** – Foam glass does not rot, does not require protective membranes, and maintains compressive strength even with freeze-thaw cycles. XPS can compress, puncture, or delaminate under backfill pressure, so protective layers and careful installation become critical to avoid localized performance loss.

### Cost Per Impact (CPI)
- **Upfront material cost** – Foam glass typically costs more per square foot than XPS because of the heavier manufacturing process and material density. Contractors pricing per ton must factor in both material and freight differences. XPS’s low weight and long history make its cost profile more predictable.
- **Installation complexity** – Foam glass blocks or gravel need heavier handling equipment and precise placement but can double as a drainage layer, simplifying some assemblies. XPS installs quickly with standard crews but often requires additional protection (e.g., drainage boards or geotextiles) to avoid damage.
- **Replacement risk** – Foam glass’s permanence means replacements are rarely necessary, so CPI improves over the life of the structure. XPS may lose R-value as the blowing agents escape, which invites future remediation or added layers to compensate.
- **Long-term value** – In high-stakes below-grade assemblies where access is limited, foam glass justifies its premium through durability, moisture immunity, and stable performance. XPS remains practical for more budget-driven builds where replacements or repairs are manageable and supply chains favor the foam.

### Summary takeaway
Choose foam glass for critical below-grade applications where moisture, chemical exposure, or compressive loads could jeopardize long-term performance—its inert chemistry and resilience create a low-risk envelope despite higher first costs. Lean on XPS when budgets, lead time, and contractor familiarity dominate, as long as protective detailing, drainage, and backfill quality are prioritized to guard against long-term thermal drift and environmental exposure.
