## InsightBox — Airtightness vs Insulation Quantity

### At a glance

This comparison examines whether it is more effective to invest in **greater airtightness** or simply add **more insulation** in residential buildings.

Both reduce energy use, but they act on different failure modes. Insulation slows heat flow; airtightness stops uncontrolled air movement that carries heat and moisture. In real buildings, air leakage often dominates performance losses long before insulation levels are maxed out.

**Common misconception**
- "If I just add more insulation, performance will follow."

**Reality**
- Past a certain point, **air leakage becomes the limiting factor**, and additional insulation delivers diminishing returns.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied impact**
- Improving airtightness typically relies on **tapes, membranes, gaskets, and detailing**, which add relatively little embodied carbon compared to large increases in insulation thickness.
- Adding insulation—especially petrochemical foams or high-density mineral products—can significantly increase embodied energy and CO₂ per marginal R-value gained.

**Operational performance**
- Air leakage drives heating and cooling losses, especially in cold and mixed climates.
- A moderately insulated but airtight building often outperforms a highly insulated but leaky one over its service life.

**Durability**
- Airtight assemblies reduce moisture transport into walls and roofs, lowering long-term risk of condensation and material degradation.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Improving airtightness usually delivers **more lifecycle benefit per unit of added material impact** than simply increasing insulation thickness.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Resilience & durability**
- Airtight buildings maintain interior comfort longer during power outages ("passive survivability").
- Reduced moisture migration protects framing, insulation, and finishes over decades.

**Material efficiency**
- Airtightness allows designers to **right-size insulation**, avoiding unnecessary material extraction.
- Fewer materials, longer service life, and lower replacement rates align with regenerative principles.

**System compatibility**
- Airtightness improves the effectiveness of **ERVs/HRVs**, heat pumps, and low-temperature heating systems.
- Leaky buildings undermine even the best mechanical systems.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Airtightness supports **durability, resilience, and material restraint**, all core regenerative goals.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Airtightness improvements often cost **less than large insulation upgrades**, especially when integrated early in design and construction.
- Tapes and membranes are inexpensive compared to thick foam or specialty insulation.

**Cost-per-performance**
- Airtightness delivers **predictable performance gains** across climates.
- Extra insulation without airtightness can yield inconsistent results depending on workmanship and weather exposure.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Dollar for dollar, airtightness almost always produces **better cost-per-impact** than adding insulation beyond code-minimum levels.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Start with airtightness.**
- Use insulation to meet thermal targets, not to compensate for leaks.
- Once a building is reasonably airtight, additional insulation becomes more valuable and more durable.

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *A tight building with "enough" insulation beats a leaky building with "a lot" of insulation — every time.*
