## InsightBox — Airtightness vs Insulation Quantity

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two common upgrade paths:
- **Improving airtightness** (continuous barrier, detailing)
- **Adding more insulation** (thicker assemblies, more material)

Both reduce energy use. Insulation slows heat flow; airtightness stops uncontrolled air movement that carries heat and moisture. In many buildings, leakage limits performance before insulation levels do.

**Core idea:**  
Insulation only works when air isn’t bypassing it.  
Tighten the envelope first; then insulation pays off.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied impact trade-off**
- Airtightness relies on **tapes, membranes, gaskets, and detailing** — small amounts of material compared to big jumps in insulation thickness.
- Adding insulation (especially foams or dense mineral products) increases **embodied energy and carbon per marginal R-value**.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Air-sealing materials typically add **less embodied impact per unit of performance gain** than adding insulation material.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture control & durability**
- Less **moisture migration** into assemblies protects framing, insulation, and finishes over time.

**Resilience during power loss**
- Airtight buildings **hold comfort longer during outages** (passive survivability).

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Airtightness supports **moisture control, durability, and resilience during power loss**.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Cost per performance**
- Airtightness usually costs **less than big insulation upgrades** when planned early; tapes, membranes, and detailing labor compare favorably to thick foam or extra cavity fill.
- Tightening the envelope often gives **predictable comfort gains per dollar**; extra insulation in a leaky assembly often does not. Blower door testing measures leakage; R-value alone does not predict real-world performance.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Where **leakage dominates losses**, air sealing typically delivers **more comfort per dollar** than adding R. Where the envelope is already tight, adding insulation to meet thermal targets is the next step.

### Performance notes

- Blower door testing and targets (e.g. ACH50) make airtightness measurable; R-value alone does not predict real-world performance.

### Installation & risk

- Airtightness needs a **continuous barrier** (sheathing, membranes, tapes, gaskets) and trade coordination; one gap can undermine the strategy.
- Right-size insulation after the envelope is tight; avoid overbuilding to compensate for leaks.

---

### Summary Takeaway

- **Invest in airtightness first** when **leakage dominates losses** (blower door and observation guide the call).
- **Add insulation** when the **enclosure is already tight**, to meet thermal targets.

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Seal first when leakage is the weak link. Add R when air control is already solid.*
