## InsightBox — Roofing Materials: Asphalt Shingle vs Metal vs Membrane

### At a glance

This InsightBox compares three common roofing material categories:
- **Asphalt shingles**
- **Metal roofing**
- **Membrane roofs** (EPDM, TPO, PVC)

The differences show up in **service life, embodied impact, maintenance cycles, and cost-per-year of use**.

---

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Asphalt Shingles

- Petroleum-based product with mineral granules.
- Shorter service life:
  - Typically 15–30 years.
- High replacement frequency increases lifecycle impact.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Low upfront impact, but **high cumulative impact** due to frequent replacement.

---

### Metal Roofing

- Steel or aluminum panels.
- Higher upfront embodied energy.
- Long service life:
  - Often 40–70 years.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Higher initial impact, but **lower impact per year** when longevity is realized.

---

### Membrane Roofing (EPDM / TPO / PVC)

- Common on low-slope roofs.
- Petrochemical-based sheets.
- Service life varies widely based on installation and maintenance.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Moderate-to-high embodied impact, sensitive to detailing quality and replacement cycles.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Durability & repairability

- **Asphalt**
  - Easy to install.
  - Limited repairability; damage often leads to replacement.
- **Metal**
  - Highly durable.
  - Repairable panels and long-term performance.
- **Membrane**
  - Repairable in theory.
  - Vulnerable to punctures and seam failures if neglected.

### Climate & performance

- **Asphalt**
  - Absorbs heat; can increase cooling loads.
- **Metal**
  - Reflective options reduce heat gain.
  - Performs well in snow-shedding climates.
- **Membrane**
  - Excellent for low-slope roofs where other materials fail.

**RIS verdict:**  
Metal roofs score highest on **longevity and resilience** when properly installed.

---

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Asphalt**
  - Lowest first cost.
- **Metal**
  - Higher upfront cost.
- **Membrane**
  - Mid-to-high cost depending on system.

### Lifetime cost

- **Asphalt**
  - Often replaced multiple times over a building’s life.
- **Metal**
  - Often lasts the life of the building.
- **Membrane**
  - CPI depends on maintenance discipline.

**CPI verdict:**  
Metal often wins on **cost per year of service** despite higher upfront cost.

---

## Summary Takeaway

- **Best budget-driven choice:**
  - Asphalt shingles, with clear expectations about replacement.
- **Best long-term, low-intervention choice:**
  - Metal roofing.
- **Best solution for low-slope roofs:**
  - Membrane systems, with regular inspection and maintenance.

**Design guidance:**
- Choose roofing based on **roof slope, climate, and expected building life**, not just first cost.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Roofs fail from neglect, not just materials. Choose a system you can afford to maintain—or one that barely needs it.*
