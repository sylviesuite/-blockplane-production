## InsightBox — Hardwood vs Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP)

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **real wood flooring** (solid or engineered hardwood) versus **luxury vinyl plank (LVP)** and similar rigid vinyl products.

Both can deliver attractive, durable floors. The differences show up in **embodied carbon, repairability, indoor air quality, and how they age over time**.

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Hardwood (Solid or Engineered)

- Wood stores **biogenic carbon** for the life of the floor.
- Solid hardwood uses more wood but can last **many decades**.
- Engineered hardwood uses less face wood but more processing and adhesives.
- End-of-life options:
  - Reuse in other applications
  - Energy recovery (combustion)
  - Landfill (still bound carbon for some time)

**LIS snapshot:**  
When responsibly sourced, hardwood has a **strong lifecycle profile**, especially if the building is long-lived and the floor stays in place.

### Luxury Vinyl Plank (LVP)

- Primarily made from **PVC (polyvinyl chloride)** plus fillers and plasticizers.
- Fully fossil-based; **no biogenic carbon**.
- Manufacturing is energy- and chemistry-intensive.
- Difficult to recycle in practice; most goes to landfill or incineration.
- Long service life but ultimately a **plastic waste stream**.

**LIS snapshot:**  
High embodied impact per square foot with limited circularity; durability helps but does not erase the fossil and end-of-life issues.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Health & indoor air

- **Hardwood**
  - Low-emission when finished with **low-VOC coatings**.
  - Simple material composition (wood + finish).
  - Can be periodically refinished instead of replaced.
- **LVP**
  - Potential for **VOC and plasticizer off-gassing**, especially lower-cost products.
  - Chemistry varies widely by manufacturer.
  - Susceptible to damage from high heat; some products can shrink or curl.

### Repair, look, and feel

- Hardwood:
  - Can be **spot repaired and re-sanded**.
  - Develops patina; dents can be sanded or embraced.
  - Feels warmer and more “alive” underfoot.
- LVP:
  - Highly scratch- and water-resistant surface.
  - Pattern is printed; repeating patterns can look artificial.
  - When damaged, individual planks are replaced rather than repaired.

**RIS verdict:**  
For regenerative goals, **hardwood wins** on material simplicity, repairability, and long-term compatibility with healthy interiors. LVP trades those for robustness in wet or rental-heavy scenarios.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Hardwood**
  - Higher material cost, especially solid wood.
  - Installation and finishing can be labor-intensive.
- **LVP**
  - Often cheaper per square foot.
  - Click-together installation is fast and DIY-friendly.
  - Many products are factory-finished; no site finishing.

### Lifetime value

- Hardwood:
  - Can last **50+ years** with refinishing.
  - Multiple remodels can happen around the same floor.
- LVP:
  - Typical lifespan **15–25 years** in real-world use.
  - Replacement often coincides with style changes or wear.
  - Entire floor becomes waste; little reuse potential.

**CPI verdict:**  
- For owner-occupied, long-term homes, **hardwood delivers better cost-per-impact** when viewed over decades.  
- For short-horizon, high-turnover spaces (rentals, quick flips), **LVP can win on short-term cost and abuse resistance**, at the expense of carbon and waste.

## Summary Takeaway

- **Best choice for long-lived, climate-conscious projects:**
  - **Hardwood flooring** (solid or high-quality engineered) with:
    - Responsible sourcing
    - Low-VOC finishes
    - Humidity control
- **Where LVP makes practical sense:**
  - Wet-prone zones where tile is not desired (basements, mudrooms, some kitchens).
  - High-abuse, short-horizon spaces where:
    - Budget is tight
    - Replacement expectations are built in.

**Design guidance:**
- Avoid defaulting to LVP purely for aesthetics; recognize the **plastic and waste implications**.
- If using LVP:
  - Prefer higher-quality, low-VOC, third-party-tested products.
  - Use it selectively, not wall-to-wall.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If the floor is meant to age with the house, choose wood. If you’re bracing for abuse in a short-term space, LVP is a tool — not a lifestyle.*
