## InsightBox — Vented vs Unvented Roof Assemblies

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **vented roof assemblies** (cold roofs with attic or vent channels) versus **unvented roof assemblies** (hot roofs with insulation at the roof deck).

Both approaches can be safe and high-performance. The differences show up in **moisture management, complexity, climate sensitivity, and risk when details go wrong**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Materials & insulation strategy**

- **Vented Roof**
  - Insulation at ceiling plane (attic floor) or between rafters with a vent channel above.
  - Often uses **fiberglass, cellulose, or mineral wool**, plus simple baffles.
  - Lower material intensity at the roof deck.
- **Unvented Roof**
  - Insulation directly at the roof sheathing: spray foam, rigid boards, dense-pack, or hybrids.
  - Can involve **higher-impact materials** (spray foam, rigid foam) to meet building-physics requirements.

**Complexity & error tolerance**

- Vented roofs are typically **simpler and more forgiving** when detailed correctly.
- Unvented roofs can be low-bulk but rely heavily on correct **R-ratios, vapor control, and airtightness**.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **Vented roofs often win on lower impact and simplicity**, especially when paired with bio-based or mineral insulation. Unvented roofs pick up more embodied impact if they depend on spray foam or thick rigid foam.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture management**

- **Vented Roof**
  - Uses **airflow through the vent space** to remove moisture that escapes from the interior.
  - More tolerant of small air leaks at the ceiling plane.
  - Requires clear, continuous vent paths from eave to ridge.
- **Unvented Roof**
  - Relies on **insulation and control layers** to keep the roof deck warm and dry.
  - Dew point management is critical; wrong ratios or materials can **trap moisture at the sheathing**.
  - Works best when:
    - Exterior insulation keeps sheathing warm enough, or
    - Interior-side insulation is also a robust air and vapor control layer (e.g., spray foam).

**Repairability & inspection**

- Vented roofs:
  - Attics are easier to inspect; problems can show up visibly (staining, frost, mold).
  - Insulation at the ceiling plane is **relatively easy to adjust or replace**.
- Unvented roofs:
  - Problems at the roof deck are hidden behind finishes and insulation.
  - Repairs can be intrusive and expensive.

**Climate & resilience**

- In cold and mixed climates, vented roofs provide **extra safety margin** for moisture.
- In hot-humid or complex roofs (lots of dormers, valleys), venting can be hard to execute, and a well-designed unvented assembly may be more reliable.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Vented roofs usually score higher on resilience and inspectability**. Unvented roofs can perform very well but demand precise detailing matched to climate and geometry.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Vented Roof**
  - Often less expensive: standard framing, baffles, and loose-fill or batt insulation.
  - Attic floor insulation is one of the **most cost-effective energy upgrades**.
- **Unvented Roof**
  - Higher costs due to insulation at the roof deck (spray foam, rigid boards, or advanced dense-pack strategies).
  - More complex detailing at penetrations and transitions.

**Value over time**

- Vented roofs:
  - Good balance of cost and performance when air sealing at the ceiling plane is done well.
  - Easier to top up insulation later (blown attic insulation).
- Unvented roofs:
  - Useful when:
    - Attic is part of the conditioned space.
    - Roof geometry makes venting impractical.
    - Ductwork is in the roof volume and hard to relocate.
  - Can deliver excellent performance but with **higher stakes if details fail**.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> For most standard buildings, **vented roofs with good air sealing at the ceiling plane deliver the best cost-per-impact**. Unvented roofs are a premium solution for specific constraints.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for most projects:**
  - **Vented roof assembly** with robust air sealing at the ceiling and generous insulation.
- **When unvented makes sense:**
  - Complex roof geometries, conditioned attics, or climates/uses where venting is impractical—and only when **roof-deck R-ratios, vapor control, and airtightness are engineered carefully**.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Start by asking: *“Can this roof be vented simply and continuously?”*
  - If the honest answer is “no,” design an unvented assembly with **exact building-science guidance**, not rules of thumb.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you can vent it simply, vent it. If you can’t, design the unvented roof like a physics problem, not a guess.*
