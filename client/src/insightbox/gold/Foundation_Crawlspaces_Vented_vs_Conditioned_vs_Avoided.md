## InsightBox — Crawlspaces: Vented vs Conditioned vs Avoided

### At a glance

This InsightBox compares **vented crawlspaces**, **conditioned (sealed) crawlspaces**, and the option to **avoid crawlspaces altogether**.

Crawlspaces sit at the intersection of **soil moisture, air leakage, and durability**. When they fail, the symptoms show up as:
- Cold floors
- Musty odors
- Mold
- Pest problems
- High energy use

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Vented Crawlspaces

- Traditional approach using perimeter vents.
- Intended to “dry out” moisture with outdoor air.

**Reality**
- In cold climates: cold air chills floors and pipes.
- In humid climates: warm air condenses on cool surfaces.
- Often increases moisture instead of removing it.

**LIS snapshot:**  
High operational penalties and frequent moisture-related repairs.

---

### Conditioned (Sealed) Crawlspaces

- Crawlspace is brought **inside the thermal envelope**.
- Includes:
  - Ground vapor barrier
  - Sealed perimeter walls
  - Insulation at walls, not floors
  - Controlled air or dehumidification.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Higher upfront materials, but significantly reduced energy use and moisture damage over time.

---

### Avoided Crawlspaces (Slab or Basement Instead)

- Slab-on-grade or full basement replaces crawlspace.
- Eliminates crawlspace risks entirely.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Often the lowest lifecycle risk when site conditions allow.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Moisture & health

- **Vented crawlspaces**
  - Persistent moisture risk.
  - Poor indoor air quality.
  - Mold spores and soil gases migrate upward.
- **Conditioned crawlspaces**
  - Dry, stable environment.
  - Improved IAQ and comfort.
  - Reduced pest pressure.
- **Avoided crawlspaces**
  - Simplest, lowest-risk solution.

### Durability & serviceability

- **Vented**
  - Accelerated decay of framing.
  - Hard to inspect consistently.
- **Conditioned**
  - Framing stays warmer and drier.
  - Easier access to plumbing and wiring.
- **Avoided**
  - Fewest failure points.

**RIS verdict:**  
Conditioned crawlspaces outperform vented crawlspaces on durability and health. Avoiding crawlspaces entirely is often best.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Vented crawlspaces**
  - Lowest first cost.
  - Highest hidden risk.
- **Conditioned crawlspaces**
  - Higher upfront cost:
    - Vapor barrier
    - Air sealing
    - Insulation
    - Conditioning strategy.
- **Avoided crawlspaces**
  - Cost varies by site, but risk is reduced.

### Lifetime value

- Vented crawlspaces often require:
  - Dehumidifiers
  - Mold remediation
  - Floor insulation repairs.
- Conditioned crawlspaces:
  - Lower energy bills.
  - Fewer callbacks.

**CPI verdict:**  
Conditioned crawlspaces deliver much better **cost-per-impact** than vented crawlspaces. Avoiding crawlspaces can be best of all.

---

## Climate Considerations

- **Cold climates**
  - Vented crawlspaces perform poorly.
- **Mixed climates**
  - Conditioned crawlspaces are strongly preferred.
- **Warm/humid climates**
  - Vented crawlspaces almost always fail.
  - Sealed and conditioned is the only durable approach.

---

## Summary Takeaway

- **Avoid by default:**
  - Vented crawlspaces.
- **Best-performing crawlspace:**
  - Sealed, insulated, conditioned crawlspace with:
    - Ground vapor barrier
    - Wall insulation
    - Air sealing
    - Moisture control.
- **Best overall solution when possible:**
  - Avoid crawlspaces altogether.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you wouldn’t live in the crawlspace, don’t ventilate your house through it.*
