## InsightBox — Foundation Insulation: Interior vs Exterior

### At a glance

This InsightBox compares **interior foundation insulation** versus **exterior foundation insulation** for basements and slab edges.

Both approaches can work. The real differences show up in **moisture behavior, durability, and how forgiving the assembly is over decades**.

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Interior Foundation Insulation

- Insulation placed on the **inside** of foundation walls.
- Common materials:
  - Rigid foam
  - Mineral wool (limited use)
  - Spray foam.
- Often used in:
  - Retrofits
  - Budget-driven projects.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Lower upfront material and labor impact, but performance depends heavily on moisture control.

---

### Exterior Foundation Insulation

- Insulation placed on the **outside** of foundation walls.
- Typically paired with:
  - Waterproofing or dampproofing
  - Drainage layers.
- Requires protection above and below grade.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Higher upfront material use, often offset by improved durability and reduced moisture risk.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Moisture behavior (core difference)

- **Interior insulation**
  - Leaves concrete cold and in contact with soil.
  - Concrete stays near ground temperature.
  - Moisture can accumulate behind insulation if water control fails.
- **Exterior insulation**
  - Keeps concrete **warmer and drier**.
  - Moves condensation risk outward.
  - Improves drying potential toward the interior.

### Durability & structure

- **Interior insulation**
  - Can hide moisture issues until damage is advanced.
  - Freeze–thaw stress on concrete remains higher.
- **Exterior insulation**
  - Reduces thermal cycling of concrete.
  - Protects foundation from freeze–thaw damage.

### Repairability & access

- **Interior insulation**
  - Easier to install and modify later.
  - Repairs often invasive once finished.
- **Exterior insulation**
  - Harder to access after backfilling.
  - Failures are less likely if detailed correctly.

**RIS verdict:**  
Exterior insulation offers **greater long-term resilience** by protecting the foundation itself, not just the interior space.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Interior insulation**
  - Lower cost.
  - Minimal excavation.
- **Exterior insulation**
  - Higher cost due to:
    - Excavation
    - Protective layers
    - Detailing at grade transitions.

### Lifetime value

- **Interior insulation**
  - CPI depends on perfect water management.
- **Exterior insulation**
  - CPI improves by:
    - Reducing moisture-related repairs
    - Extending foundation life.

**CPI verdict:**  
Exterior insulation often delivers better **cost-per-risk-reduction**, especially in cold and mixed climates.

---

## Climate & Use Considerations

- **Cold climates**
  - Exterior insulation greatly reduces condensation and frost damage.
- **Retrofits**
  - Interior insulation may be the only practical option.
- **High water tables**
  - Exterior insulation must be paired with robust drainage systems.

---

## Summary Takeaway

- **Best default for new construction:**
  - **Exterior foundation insulation**, integrated with:
    - Waterproofing
    - Drainage
    - Protection above grade.
- **When interior insulation is appropriate:**
  - Retrofits.
  - Projects with tight budgets and strong moisture control.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Treat foundation insulation as part of a **water management system**, not just a thermal upgrade.
  - If water control is weak, insulation location will not save the building.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Insulating the inside makes the space warmer. Insulating the outside makes the foundation safer.*
