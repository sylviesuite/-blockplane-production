## InsightBox — Continuous Insulation: Exterior vs Interior

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **continuous insulation (CI)** placed on the **exterior** of a wall versus CI placed on the **interior**.

Both approaches reduce thermal bridging. The real differences show up in **moisture control, durability, retrofit suitability, and how forgiving the assembly is over time**.

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Exterior Continuous Insulation

- CI installed outside the structural wall and sheathing.
- Materials often include:
  - Rigid foam
  - Mineral wool boards
  - Wood fiber boards
- Allows:
  - Thinner cavity insulation
  - Warmer sheathing temperatures.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Moderate added material impact, often offset by improved thermal performance and reduced risk of moisture-related failures.

---

### Interior Continuous Insulation

- CI installed on the interior side of framing or masonry.
- Materials typically include:
  - Rigid foam
  - Mineral wool
  - Insulated service cavities.
- Often used in:
  - Retrofits
  - Historic buildings where exterior appearance must remain unchanged.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Lower impact additions in retrofit contexts, but performance depends heavily on detailing and climate.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Moisture behavior (critical difference)

- **Exterior CI**
  - Keeps structural sheathing **warmer and drier**.
  - Reduces condensation risk inside wall cavities.
  - Improves drying potential toward the interior.
- **Interior CI**
  - Pushes the dew point **into the structural wall**.
  - Increases condensation risk if vapor and air control layers are imperfect.
  - Requires climate-specific vapor control strategies.

### Durability & repairability

- **Exterior CI**
  - Protects framing from thermal stress and moisture cycling.
  - Simplifies long-term durability.
- **Interior CI**
  - Can hide moisture issues until damage is advanced.
  - Repairs often require interior demolition.

### Buildability & adaptability

- **Exterior CI**
  - Adds complexity at:
    - Windows
    - Doors
    - Roof and foundation transitions.
  - Once detailed, assemblies are robust and forgiving.
- **Interior CI**
  - Easier to install in occupied buildings.
  - Reduces interior space slightly.
  - Limits access to framing for future work.

**RIS verdict:**  
Exterior CI offers **greater resilience and moisture safety**. Interior CI is more fragile but sometimes necessary due to project constraints.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Exterior CI**
  - Higher material and labor cost.
  - Requires:
    - Furring
    - Extended fasteners
    - Careful detailing at openings.
- **Interior CI**
  - Lower cost in retrofit situations.
  - Uses standard interior construction techniques.

### Lifetime value

- **Exterior CI**
  - Reduces long-term risk of hidden moisture damage.
  - Improves comfort and energy performance consistently.
- **Interior CI**
  - CPI depends on:
    - Climate
    - Vapor control execution
    - Monitoring and maintenance.

**CPI verdict:**  
Exterior CI often delivers better **cost-per-unit-of-risk-reduction** over the building’s life. Interior CI can make sense when exterior changes are impossible.

## Summary Takeaway

- **Best default approach:**
  - **Exterior continuous insulation**, especially in:
    - Cold and mixed climates
    - New construction
    - High-performance wall assemblies.
- **When interior CI is appropriate:**
  - Retrofits with:
    - Historic exteriors
    - Lot-line or zoning constraints
  - Projects with careful vapor and air control detailing.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Don’t mix CI strategies casually.
  - Always design CI with:
    - Climate-specific dew point control
    - Clear drying paths
    - Inspectable air barriers.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Exterior CI makes walls safer by default. Interior CI can work—but only when you understand exactly where the moisture is going.*
