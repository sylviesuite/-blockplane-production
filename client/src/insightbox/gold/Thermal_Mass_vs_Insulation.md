## InsightBox — Thermal Mass vs Insulation

### At a glance

Thermal mass and insulation solve **different problems**.

This comparison looks at:
- **Thermal mass** (concrete, masonry, rammed earth)
- **Insulation-first assemblies** (high-R, low-mass walls)

**Core idea:**  
Thermal mass moderates temperature swings, while insulation reduces energy loss.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Thermal mass**
- High embodied energy (especially concrete-based mass)
- Long service life
- Can reduce peak heating/cooling demand in the right climate

**Insulation-first assemblies**
- Lower embodied energy per unit of performance
- Faster energy payback
- Easier to upgrade and repair

**Climate sensitivity**
- Mass performs best with:
  - Diurnal temperature swings
  - Solar gain access
- Performs poorly when:
  - Buried behind insulation
  - Used in cloudy, cold climates without solar input

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Insulation delivers reliable energy savings everywhere; mass is climate- and design-dependent.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Comfort**
- Thermal mass smooths indoor temperature swings
- Insulation stabilizes interior conditions continuously

**System interaction**
- Mass works best when exposed to interior air
- Insulation works regardless of layout or orientation

**Durability**
- Mass structures can last centuries
- Insulated assemblies rely on moisture control and detailing

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Mass supports comfort and longevity when used intentionally, not as a substitute for insulation.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Thermal mass is material- and labor-intensive
- Insulation-first walls are cheaper and faster to build

**Operational savings**
- Mass can reduce peak loads
- Insulation consistently reduces total energy demand

**Value per dollar**
- Insulation delivers predictable returns
- Mass only pays off when climate and design align

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Insulation almost always wins on cost-per-impact; mass is a performance enhancer, not a baseline.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Thermal mass**
  - Buffers temperature swings
  - Shines in sunny climates with daily temperature variation
  - Adds durability and comfort when exposed correctly

- **Insulation**
  - Reduces energy loss in all climates
  - Delivers consistent, measurable performance
  - Forms the foundation of low-energy buildings

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *Insulate first. Add mass only when the climate and design can use it.*
