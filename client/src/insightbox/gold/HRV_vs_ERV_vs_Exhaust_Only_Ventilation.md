## InsightBox — HRV vs ERV vs Exhaust-Only Ventilation

### At a glance

This comparison looks at three common whole-building ventilation strategies:

- **HRV (Heat Recovery Ventilator)**
- **ERV (Energy Recovery Ventilator)**
- **Exhaust-Only Ventilation** (bath fans, range hoods, or central exhaust)

All three can meet code requirements. The differences show up in **energy use, comfort, moisture control, and indoor air quality**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Equipment & energy**

- **HRV**
  - Balanced system: brings in fresh air and exhausts stale air through a **heat exchanger**.
  - Recovers sensible heat (temperature), reducing heating and cooling loads.
- **ERV**
  - Similar to HRV, but also exchanges some **moisture** between air streams.
  - Can reduce both heating/cooling and humidity-control loads.
- **Exhaust-Only**
  - Fans pull air out of the building; fresh air leaks in through cracks or passive inlets.
  - Lowest equipment complexity, but no heat recovery.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **HRVs and ERVs use more equipment upfront** but can significantly **reduce operational energy use** in tight, well-insulated homes. Exhaust-only is simpler but less efficient over time.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Air quality & comfort**

- **HRV**
  - Provides controlled, balanced fresh air.
  - Helps avoid drafts and cold air dumping near inlets.
  - Maintains more stable indoor temperatures.
- **ERV**
  - Does what an HRV does, plus:
    - Moderates humidity swings by sharing moisture between incoming and outgoing air.
  - Particularly helpful in **humid or very dry climates**.
- **Exhaust-Only**
  - Depressurizes the building.
  - Draws in makeup air through leaks, which may come from:
    - Crawlspaces
    - Garages
    - Other low-quality sources
  - Air quality and comfort are **less predictable**.

**Moisture & durability**

- HRV/ERV:
  - Paired with a tight envelope, they **control where and how fresh air enters**, reducing moisture risk in assemblies.
- Exhaust-only:
  - Can pull moist air into walls or roofs if pressure imbalances are strong.
  - Can backdraft combustion appliances if not designed carefully.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **HRVs and ERVs score higher** for indoor air quality, comfort, and moisture safety—especially in tighter homes. Exhaust-only is best reserved for leaky or very simple buildings.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Exhaust-Only**
  - Lowest cost: a few fans plus controls.
  - Easy to install with minimal design work.
- **HRV/ERV**
  - Higher equipment and installation cost.
  - Requires ducting, commissioning, and filter access.

**Value over time**

- HRV:
  - Strong value in **cold and mixed-cold climates** with tight envelopes.
  - Reduces heating demand and improves comfort.
- ERV:
  - Best where **humidity swings** are significant (hot-humid or very cold, very dry climates).
  - Can reduce dehumidification or humidification loads.
- Exhaust-only:
  - “Good enough” for code-minimum or leaky homes, but:
    - Wastes heat.
    - Makes performance harder to predict.
    - Can compromise comfort.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> **Exhaust-only is cheapest to install**, but **HRVs/ERVs offer better cost-per-impact** in efficient, tight buildings by pairing ventilation with comfort and energy savings.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for high-performance homes:**
  - **HRV** in cold/mixed-cold climates with relatively balanced humidity.
  - **ERV** where humidity control is critical (humid or very dry regions, or high internal moisture loads).
- **When exhaust-only can be acceptable:**
  - Simple, budget-driven projects with:
    - Leaky envelopes, or
    - Very mild climates.
  - Still requires attention to **makeup air sources and combustion safety**.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Treat mechanical ventilation as part of the **core building system**, not an add-on.
  - Tight buildings **need** balanced ventilation (HRV/ERV) to stay healthy and comfortable.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you’re going to tighten the box, upgrade the lungs. HRV/ERV first, exhaust-only only when simplicity truly justifies it.*
