## InsightBox — Attic Insulation: Flat Attic vs Cathedral Ceiling

### At a glance

This InsightBox compares **flat attics** (insulation at the ceiling plane) with **cathedral ceilings** (insulation following the roof slope).

Both can meet energy codes and deliver comfort. The differences show up in **cost, air-sealing difficulty, durability, and how forgiving the assembly is over time**.

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Flat Attic (Insulation at Ceiling Plane)

- Insulation sits on top of the ceiling:
  - Loose-fill cellulose
  - Blown fiberglass
  - Batts (less ideal, but common).
- Very efficient use of material:
  - Large insulation depth
  - Minimal framing interference.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Often the **lowest-impact way** to achieve high R-values because it uses less material and simpler detailing.

---

### Cathedral Ceiling (Insulation at Roof Plane)

- Insulation installed between or above rafters.
- Common approaches:
  - Dense-pack cellulose
  - Mineral wool
  - Spray foam
  - Hybrid assemblies (rigid + fluffy).
- More framing per square foot → more thermal bridges.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Higher material intensity and higher embodied impact per unit of R-value compared to flat attics.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Air sealing & moisture risk

- **Flat Attics**
  - Air barrier is the ceiling:
    - Easier to make continuous.
    - Easier to inspect before insulation.
  - Venting above insulation provides moisture forgiveness.
- **Cathedral Ceilings**
  - Air barrier is harder to execute perfectly.
  - Small air leaks can cause:
    - Condensation at roof deck
    - Long-term moisture damage.

### Durability & serviceability

- **Flat Attics**
  - Easy access for:
    - Repairs
    - Insulation upgrades
    - Future wiring.
- **Cathedral Ceilings**
  - Everything is buried:
    - Repairs are invasive.
    - Future upgrades are difficult or impossible.

**RIS verdict:**  
Flat attics score higher on **resilience, inspectability, and long-term adaptability**.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Flat Attics**
  - Lowest-cost insulation strategy.
  - Fast installation.
  - Minimal specialty labor.
- **Cathedral Ceilings**
  - Higher labor and material cost.
  - Often require spray foam or hybrid systems to control moisture.

### Lifetime value

- **Flat Attics**
  - Excellent CPI:
    - High performance
    - Low cost
    - Easy upgrades.
- **Cathedral Ceilings**
  - CPI depends on:
    - Execution quality
    - Climate
    - Whether the space below truly needs a vaulted ceiling.

## Summary Takeaway

- **Best default choice:**
  - **Flat, vented attic with deep loose-fill insulation.**
- **When cathedral ceilings make sense:**
  - Architectural intent requires them.
  - Roof assembly is carefully designed and executed.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Don’t trade durability and simplicity for ceiling height unless the design truly benefits.
  - If you go cathedral, invest heavily in:
    - Air sealing
    - Moisture control
    - Proper insulation ratios.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *A flat attic is cheap, durable, and easy to improve. A cathedral ceiling is a commitment—make sure the architecture earns it.*
