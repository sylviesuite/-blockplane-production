## InsightBox — Heat Pumps vs Gas Furnaces (Carbon & Resilience View)

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **modern electric heat pumps** versus **natural gas furnaces** as the primary heating system in homes and small buildings.

Both can keep a building comfortable. The differences show up in **carbon trajectory, efficiency, resilience, and how well they fit into an all-electric, future-ready building**.

---

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Energy source & carbon**

- **Heat Pumps**
  - Run on **electricity** and move heat rather than creating it.
  - Efficiency is measured as a **coefficient of performance (COP)**: often 2–4+, meaning 2–4 units of heat delivered per 1 unit of electricity.
  - Carbon impact depends on the **electric grid mix** (and becomes cleaner as the grid decarbonizes).
- **Gas Furnaces**
  - Burn natural gas on site.
  - Even high-efficiency condensing furnaces (90–98% AFUE) are limited by combustion chemistry.
  - Lock the building into **fossil fuel combustion** for its service life.

**Equipment & lifespan**

- Heat pumps:
  - Similar components to air conditioners; outdoor and indoor units, refrigerant circuits.
  - Can provide **both heating and cooling** with one system.
- Gas furnaces:
  - Provide heat only; usually paired with a separate AC or left without cooling.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> In most grids—and especially over the coming decades—**heat pumps have a better carbon trajectory**, while gas furnaces keep emissions tied directly to fossil fuel use.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Comfort & distribution**

- **Heat Pumps**
  - Offer **modulating or multi-stage operation**, which can:
    - Reduce temperature swings.
    - Improve comfort and humidity control.
  - Can pair well with **low-temperature distribution** (ducted, ductless heads, or radiant with special designs).
- **Gas Furnaces**
  - Often run as on/off appliances with higher supply temperatures.
  - Can create **hot-blast / cold-fall cycles** if ducts or controls are not tuned.

**Resilience & future-proofing**

- Heat pumps:
  - Align with **electrification and decarbonization** policies.
  - Benefit as the grid gets cleaner or when paired with **on-site renewables**.
  - Provide built-in cooling as summers get hotter.
- Gas furnaces:
  - Depend on two infrastructures: the electric grid (for controls/fans) and the gas network.
  - Face potential **policy and fuel-cost risks** in future carbon-constrained scenarios.

**Health & indoor air quality**

- Heat pumps:
  - No on-site combustion; reduced risk of:
    - CO leaks
    - Combustion byproducts in living spaces
- Gas furnaces:
  - Safe when installed and vented correctly, but add:
    - Flue penetrations
    - Combustion safety considerations (backdrafting in some configurations)

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Heat pumps score higher** on regenerative metrics: future alignment, absence of on-site combustion, and the ability to serve both heating and cooling in a changing climate.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Heat Pumps**
  - Often higher upfront cost than a simple gas furnace replacement.
  - However, can **replace both furnace and AC** in one system.
- **Gas Furnaces**
  - Lower cost for heat-only replacements.
  - Additional cost if a separate AC system is needed.

**Operating costs**

- Heat pump economics depend on:
  - **Electricity vs gas prices**.
  - Climate (colder climates need cold-climate-rated units and good building envelopes).
- In many regions, high-efficiency heat pumps are competitive or cheaper to run than gas when:
  - Envelope is improved.
  - Tariffs or time-of-use rates favor off-peak electricity.

**Resilience & long-term value**

- Heat pumps:
  - Future energy upgrades (solar, battery, cleaner grid) **directly improve their carbon and cost profile**.
- Gas furnaces:
  - Vulnerable to fuel price volatility and potential future carbon pricing.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> **Gas furnaces can win on short-term install cost**, especially as straight replacements. **Heat pumps tend to win on cost-per-impact** when you zoom out to include cooling, carbon, and long-term energy trends.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for future-ready buildings:**
  - **Cold-climate-capable heat pump system**, sized and designed for the envelope and climate.
- **When gas furnaces remain on the table:**
  - Budget-limited replacements in existing buildings where:
    - Short-term cost is the only driver, and
    - Cooling is not being added or is handled separately.
- **Design guidance:**
  - For new builds and deep retrofits, assume **heat pump first**, and design the envelope and electrical system to support it.
  - Treat gas furnaces as a **legacy solution** that will face increasing carbon and policy pressure over the building’s life.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you’re building for the next 30 years, design for a heat pump. Gas is a short-term decision in a long-term building.*
