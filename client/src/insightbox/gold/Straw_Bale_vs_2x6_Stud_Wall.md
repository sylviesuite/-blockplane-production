## InsightBox — Straw Bale vs 2×6 Fiberglass Stud Wall

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **straw bale walls** (structural or infill bales with plasters) versus a **conventional 2×6 stud wall with fiberglass batts**.

Both can meet modern energy codes. The differences show up in **carbon story, wall thickness and comfort, moisture behavior, and how much the system depends on perfect control layers**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied energy & carbon**

- **Straw Bale**
  - Uses **agricultural byproduct** (straw) that would otherwise be waste or low-value.
  - Very low embodied energy: baling and transport are the main inputs.
  - Straw stores **biogenic carbon**, and lime or clay plasters can be relatively low-impact when sourced and mixed carefully.
  - Overall, straw bale walls can be **ultra-low carbon or net carbon storing**, depending on finishes and structure.
- **2×6 Fiberglass Stud Wall**
  - Dimensional lumber, OSB/plywood sheathing, fiberglass batts, and standard claddings.
  - Fiberglass has **moderate embodied energy** with no carbon storage benefit.
  - Lumber stores biogenic carbon but is offset by higher-impact sheathing and finishes.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **Straw bale is one of the lowest-impact wall systems available**, especially where straw is locally abundant and plasters are kept simple and mineral-based.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & hygrothermal behavior**

- **Straw Bale**
  - Thick, **vapor-open and hygroscopic** assembly.
  - Walls can absorb, redistribute, and release moisture when paired with **breathable plasters** (lime/clay).
  - Highly sensitive to bulk water: details at foundations, openings, and tops of walls must keep bales dry.
- **2×6 Fiberglass Stud Wall**
  - Fiberglass does not store or buffer moisture.
  - Relies on **distinct air and vapor control layers** to prevent condensation.
  - Air leaks can drive moisture into cold zones, increasing mold and rot risk.

**Thermal comfort & mass**

- Straw bale walls:
  - Very thick, with high R-value and some mass → **stable interior temperatures and quieter interiors**.
  - Manage both heat flow and sound well.
- 2×6 walls:
  - Light and relatively thin; interior conditions react more quickly to outside swings.
  - Comfort depends heavily on HVAC and interior finishes.

**Durability & repairability**

- Straw bale:
  - Long-lasting when kept dry and well-detailed.
  - Repairs are possible but more specialized; patching plasters and local bale replacement takes skill.
- 2×6 fiberglass:
  - Easy to open and patch, but also **easy to quietly degrade** through repeated renovations that damage control layers.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Straw bale scores higher** on regenerative metrics: bio-based, carbon-storing, moisture-buffering, and quiet, comfortable interiors—provided details keep liquid water away from the bales.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Straw Bale**
  - Material cost for straw is often low; **labor and detailing drive cost**.
  - Requires crews trained in stacking, pinning, and plastering.
  - Wall thickness impacts foundations, roof overhangs, and window/door detailing.
- **2×6 Fiberglass Stud Wall**
  - The **commodity baseline**: cheap, fast, and familiar.
  - Widely available materials, standard inspections, and known schedules.

**Value over time**

- Straw bale:
  - High comfort, low operating demand, and **strong carbon story**.
  - Moisture robustness depends almost entirely on good detailing and ongoing maintenance of plasters and splash protection.
- 2×6 fiberglass:
  - Acceptable performance when **air sealing and vapor control are carefully executed and preserved**.
  - More vulnerable to long-term performance drift from small leaks and remodels.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> On day-one dollars, **2×6 fiberglass is cheaper and simpler to permit**. On **cost-per-impact**—carbon, comfort, and long-term resilience—**straw bale can be a superior value** where the project can accommodate its thickness and craftsmanship needs.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for ultra-low-carbon flagship builds:**
  - **Straw bale walls** with robust bulk-water detailing, breathable plasters, and adequate roof and foundation design.
- **When 2×6 fiberglass walls remain appropriate:**
  - Budget-driven work, production housing, and teams not ready for alternative wall systems, provided the design includes **excellent air-sealing and moisture details**.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Use straw bale where you want the wall itself to act as **insulation, carbon store, and comfort engine**, not just a cavity to fill.
  - Treat 2×6 fiberglass as a **code-minimum baseline** that must be upgraded with smart control layers if you want performance approaching regenerative assemblies.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If straw is plentiful and you can keep it dry, it’s one of the kindest walls you can build for the planet. If you stay with 2×6, spend your effort on airtightness and moisture safety.*
