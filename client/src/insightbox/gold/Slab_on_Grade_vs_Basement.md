## InsightBox — Slab-on-Grade vs Basement

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two common residential foundation strategies:
- **Slab-on-grade**
- **Basement foundations**

Both can work well, but they differ significantly in energy performance, moisture risk, cost, and long-term flexibility.

**Core idea:**  
Basements add space and complexity. Slabs prioritize simplicity and control.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Slab-on-grade**
- Lower concrete volume overall
- Reduced excavation and soil disturbance
- Fewer below-grade surfaces to insulate and waterproof

**Basement**
- Higher embodied carbon due to more concrete
- Greater heat loss area below grade
- Increased waterproofing and drainage requirements

**Thermal performance**
- Slabs perform well when perimeter and sub-slab insulation are continuous
- Basements can be efficient, but only with careful wall and slab insulation

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Slab-on-grade foundations usually deliver **lower embodied impact and simpler thermal control**.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture risk**
- Slabs reduce exposure to bulk water and hydrostatic pressure
- Basements require ongoing moisture management and drainage vigilance

**Durability**
- Slabs eliminate many common basement failure modes (leaks, mold)
- Basements can last indefinitely when well detailed, but failures are costly

**Adaptability**
- Basements provide flexible future space
- Slabs lock in program decisions early

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Slabs favor long-term durability through simplicity; basements favor adaptability through added space.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Slabs are usually cheaper to build
- Basements add excavation, concrete, waterproofing, and finishing costs

**Operational cost**
- Slabs reduce heating losses
- Basements increase envelope area and system demand

**Value cases**
- Basements make sense where land is limited or space is valuable
- Slabs shine in cost-controlled, high-performance homes

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Slabs generally deliver **better cost-per-impact** unless basement space is actively used.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Slab-on-grade**
  - Lower cost and embodied carbon
  - Fewer moisture risks
  - Excellent for high-performance and electrified homes

- **Basement**
  - Adds usable space and flexibility
  - Higher cost and complexity
  - Requires strong moisture and insulation detailing

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *If you don't truly need the space, don't build the hole.*
