## Material Snapshot

| Attribute | Black Locust | Ipe |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Botanical type | Temperate hardwood | Tropical hardwood |
| Natural durability | Very high | Extremely high |
| Typical service life | 30–50+ years | 40–60+ years |
| Chemical treatment | None | None |
| Density | High | Very high |
| Slip resistance | Good | Good |
| Tool wear | Moderate | High |

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Black Locust

- Grows in **North America and Europe**.
- Can be plantation-grown or harvested from managed forests.
- Very high rot resistance due to natural extractives.
- Lower transport emissions when regionally sourced.
- Stores **biogenic carbon** in a long-lived application.

**LIS takeaway:**  
Long lifespan + regional sourcing = **excellent lifecycle carbon profile**.

---

### Ipe

- Native to Central and South America.
- Extremely dense; long service life offsets some impact.
- **Very high transport emissions**.
- Carbon footprint is dominated by:
  - Shipping distance
  - Milling energy
  - Forest disturbance risk

**LIS takeaway:**  
Longevity helps, but **transport and forest impact often dominate the carbon story**.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Ecosystem & sourcing risk

- **Black Locust**
  - Can be sourced from:
    - Local mills
    - Agroforestry
    - Managed temperate forests
  - Often considered invasive in some regions, making harvest ecologically beneficial.
- **Ipe**
  - Strong association with:
    - Deforestation
    - Illegal logging
    - Biodiversity loss
  - FSC certification reduces risk but does not eliminate it.

### Workability & repair

- Black Locust:
  - Hard but workable with standard carbide tools.
  - Easier to source replacement boards decades later.
- Ipe:
  - Extremely hard on tools and fasteners.
  - Replacement boards may not match due to species variability and supply issues.

**RIS verdict:**  
**Black Locust aligns better with regenerative and ethical sourcing principles**, especially for projects concerned with biodiversity and governance.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- Black Locust:
  - Variable by region.
  - Often **competitive with composites**.
- Ipe:
  - Consistently high material cost.
  - Higher labor cost due to density and tooling demands.

### Lifetime value

- Both materials:
  - Offer decades-long service life.
  - Can be left unfinished to weather naturally.
- Black Locust:
  - Delivers similar lifespan **with lower ethical and carbon risk**.

**CPI verdict:**  
For most projects, **Black Locust delivers superior cost-per-impact** when available regionally. Ipe only wins when absolute maximum durability is required and sourcing risk is explicitly accepted.

## Specifier Guidance

- **Choose Black Locust when:**
  - Regional sourcing is possible.
  - Carbon, ethics, and long-term resilience matter.
  - You want tropical-hardwood performance without tropical risk.
- **Choose Ipe only when:**
  - Certification is verified.
  - Client explicitly prioritizes extreme durability over sourcing concerns.
  - Transport and ecological impact are acknowledged tradeoffs.

**Specifier’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you’re specifying Ipe for durability alone, Black Locust usually meets the need with a far kinder sourcing story.*
