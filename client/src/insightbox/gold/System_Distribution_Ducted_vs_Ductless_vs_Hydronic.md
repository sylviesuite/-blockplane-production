## InsightBox — Distribution Systems: Ducted vs Ductless vs Hydronic

### At a glance

This InsightBox compares **three main ways to move heat (and sometimes cooling) through a building**:

- **Ducted air systems** (forced-air with ducts)
- **Ductless systems** (mini-splits and multi-splits)
- **Hydronic systems** (water-based: radiators, baseboards, radiant floors)

All three can keep a building comfortable. The big differences show up in **efficiency, comfort, noise, retrofit complexity, and how well they play with high-performance envelopes and low-carbon heat sources**.

## Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

### Ducted Systems

- Use **sheet metal or flex ducts** plus air handlers.
- Embodied impact tied to:
  - Duct material (metal vs flex)
  - Insulation and air sealing of duct runs
- Operational impact strongly influenced by:
  - Duct leakage
  - Location of ducts (conditioned vs unconditioned spaces)
  - Fan power and runtime

**LIS snapshot:**  
Can perform well when ducts are **short, tight, and inside the envelope**. Poorly executed ducts drive up energy use and negate equipment efficiency.

---

### Ductless Systems (Mini-Splits / Multi-Splits)

- No central duct trunk; indoor heads are wall, floor, or ceiling units.
- Less sheet metal and duct insulation required.
- High equipment efficiency, especially with inverter-driven heat pumps.
- Reduced distribution losses because **air doesn’t travel long distances through ducts**.

**LIS snapshot:**  
Lower distribution losses and high equipment efficiency make ductless systems **strong performers on lifecycle impact**, especially in smaller or zoned spaces.

---

### Hydronic Systems

- Use water in pipes to move heat.
- Distribution materials: PEX, copper, or steel.
- Distribution losses are lower than ducted air when insulated and routed well.
- Often paired with **boilers or heat pumps** and long-lived emitters (radiators, radiant floors).

**LIS snapshot:**  
Hydronic systems can deliver **very efficient distribution** over long lifespans, but require good design and insulation of piping.

## Regenerative Impact (RIS)

### Comfort & control

- **Ducted**
  - Delivers warm (or cool) air in bursts.
  - Can create temperature swings and drafts if oversized or poorly balanced.
  - Good for quick response; less gentle than hydronic or ductless zoning.
- **Ductless**
  - Provides **zoned control** room by room or zone by zone.
  - Allows occupants to condition only the spaces in use.
  - Air movement is localized; can be very comfortable in tight envelopes.
- **Hydronic**
  - Excellent radiant comfort via radiators or radiant floors.
  - Heat is typically gentle and even.
  - Works very well in high-mass or high-performance buildings.

### Noise & air quality

- **Ducted**
  - Can be noisy if ducts and air handler are not carefully designed.
  - Moves dust and allergens throughout the system if filtration isn’t maintained.
- **Ductless**
  - Quieter in high-quality systems.
  - Filters are local and easier to clean.
- **Hydronic**
  - Very quiet; little to no moving air.
  - Does not distribute dust; separate ventilation is required.

**RIS verdict:**  
Hydronic and well-designed ductless systems often provide **superior comfort and indoor air quality**. Ducted systems can perform well when carefully designed, balanced, and filtered.

## Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

### Up-front cost

- **Ducted**
  - Often lowest first cost in new construction.
  - Ductwork is a significant but standardized expense.
- **Ductless**
  - Higher cost per indoor zone than a single central ducted system.
  - Attractive for retrofits and partial electrification.
- **Hydronic**
  - Generally highest upfront cost:
    - Piping
    - Manifolds
    - Radiators or radiant floors

### Operating cost

- **Ducted**
  - Performance depends heavily on duct leakage, location, and design.
- **Ductless**
  - Typically very efficient due to:
    - High COP heat pumps
    - Minimal distribution losses
    - Zonal control
- **Hydronic**
  - Can be very efficient, especially with:
    - Low-temperature radiant
    - Condensing boilers or heat pumps
  - Pump power is usually modest compared to fan power in large duct systems.

**CPI verdict:**  
- Ducted often wins on **first cost**.  
- Ductless and hydronic usually win on **cost-per-unit-of-comfort over time**, especially in efficient buildings and when zoning is used intelligently.

## Design & Integration Notes

### When ducted makes sense

- New construction where:
  - Cooling is required anyway.
  - Ducts can be kept **inside the conditioned envelope**.
  - The design team can ensure proper sizing, balancing, and filtration.

### When ductless shines

- Retrofits where adding ducts is disruptive.
- Smaller homes, apartments, or outbuildings.
- Projects pursuing **deep energy upgrades** with zoned control.

### When hydronic is the best fit

- Buildings prioritizing:
  - Radiant comfort
  - Noise control
  - Integration with **radiant floors or panel radiators**
- Systems that plan to use:
  - Ground-source heat pumps
  - High-efficiency boilers
  - Low-temperature distribution

**Integration rule:**  
> Choose the distribution system that matches the **building’s envelope quality, zoning needs, and lifespan expectations**—not just the cheapest install.

## Summary Takeaway

- **Ducted systems**:
  - Best as a **low-first-cost, whole-house solution** when ducts are inside the envelope and well-sealed.
- **Ductless systems**:
  - Best for **zoned comfort, retrofits, and high-efficiency heat pump projects**.
- **Hydronic systems**:
  - Best for **long-lived, comfort-focused buildings**, especially with radiant floors and high-performance envelopes.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *If you’re building “standard,” ducts can work—just keep them tight and inside. If you’re building “high performance,” ductless or hydronic distribution often matches the building’s ambitions better.*
