## InsightBox — Whole-House vs Room-by-Room Systems

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two different approaches to delivering heating and cooling:
- **Whole-house systems** (single central system serving the entire building)
- **Room-by-room systems** (multiple small systems or zones serving individual spaces)

Both approaches can work well, but they reflect different priorities around control, complexity, and user behavior.

**Core idea:**  
Whole-house systems emphasize simplicity and balance.  
Room-by-room systems emphasize control and adaptability.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Whole-house systems**
- Fewer pieces of equipment
- Lower total embodied material
- Depend on good distribution design to avoid comfort issues

**Room-by-room systems**
- More equipment and controls
- Higher embodied impact upfront
- Reduced distribution losses and targeted delivery

**Performance reality**
- Whole-house systems can over-condition lightly used spaces
- Room-by-room systems reduce wasted conditioning when occupancy varies

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Whole-house systems minimize material use; room-by-room systems minimize wasted energy.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Comfort and agency**
- Room-by-room systems allow occupants to fine-tune comfort
- Whole-house systems encourage consistent conditions across spaces

**Adaptability**
- Room-by-room systems are easy to expand or modify over time
- Whole-house systems are harder to adjust but simpler to operate

**Resilience**
- Multiple small systems offer redundancy
- Single central systems are simpler but represent a single point of failure

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Distributed systems increase adaptability and resilience; centralized systems reduce complexity.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Whole-house systems often cost less initially
- Room-by-room systems cost more due to multiple units and controls

**Operating cost**
- Room-by-room systems can reduce energy use in partially occupied homes
- Whole-house systems can be efficient when loads are predictable and uniform

**Maintenance**
- Central systems are simpler to maintain
- Multiple systems increase service complexity but isolate failures

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Whole-house systems win on simplicity and cost; room-by-room systems win on control and long-term flexibility.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Whole-house systems**
  - Simple, familiar, and easier to manage
  - Best for compact or consistently occupied homes
  - Depend on good envelope and distribution design

- **Room-by-room systems**
  - Highly flexible and occupant-responsive
  - Better for varied schedules, additions, or phased upgrades
  - Support incremental electrification strategies

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *If the house is simple, keep the system simple. If the house is complex, let the systems flex.*
