## InsightBox — Dense-Pack Cellulose vs Blown-In Fiberglass

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two common cavity-fill options:
- **Dense-pack cellulose** — recycled paper fiber, borate-treated, installed at high density
- **Blown-in fiberglass** — glass fiber, blown to lower density

Both are used in new construction and retrofits. Differences show up in **air control, embodied impact, moisture behavior, and cost**.

**Core idea:**  
Cellulose adds air resistance and moisture buffering in one layer; fiberglass insulates only and depends on other layers for air control.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied impact**
- Dense-pack cellulose: **recycled paper fiber** with borate treatment; low manufacturing energy, often regional; acts as a **biogenic carbon store** for the life of the building.
- Blown-in fiberglass: sand and recycled glass; **higher embodied energy** (melt process); no carbon storage.

**Operational performance**
- Both ship compressed and install with similar equipment; installation energy is low. Cellulose is denser per cavity (slightly higher transport weight). Cellulose can be vacuumed out at end of life; fiberglass is harder to reclaim cleanly.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Dense-pack cellulose typically has **lower embodied impact** than blown-in fiberglass — recycled content, carbon storage, and low manufacturing energy.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture & durability**
- Cellulose: **hygroscopic** — absorbs, redistributes, and releases moisture within safe ranges; supports vapor-open assemblies. Resists settling when dense-packed correctly.
- Fiberglass: does not buffer moisture; air movement through the cavity can carry moisture to cold surfaces. Susceptible to settling if not installed carefully.

**Air control & retrofit**
- Cellulose at high density **reduces air movement in the cavity**; limits convective looping and is more forgiving of minor detailing. Easier to vacuum out and reuse in retrofits.
- Fiberglass is highly air-permeable; performance depends on **separate air-sealing layers** being done right.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Dense-pack cellulose often offers **better moisture buffering, air control in the cavity, and retrofit friendliness** than blown-in fiberglass.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Blown-in fiberglass: often **lowest-cost cavity fill**; fast install, crews widely available.
- Dense-pack cellulose: usually higher cost (material density, install time); needs trained installers to hit density targets.

**Return on investment**
- Cellulose combines insulation and air resistance in one layer, so heating and cooling loads can drop without relying only on membranes and tapes.
- Fiberglass tends to pay off when **budget is tight and air-sealing is already robust**; it performs only when air control elsewhere is excellent.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> Cellulose typically delivers **better cost-per-impact** where air control and insulation are both goals; fiberglass often wins on **upfront cost** when air-sealing is already in place.

### Performance notes

- Cellulose performance depends on **installed density** (target specs matter); fiberglass performance depends on limiting settling and on air-sealing quality elsewhere. Neither replaces a continuous air barrier when the assembly requires one.

### Installation & risk

- Dense-pack needs the right equipment and technique to avoid overpacking (framing stress) or underpacking (settling, reduced R). Blown-in fiberglass needs careful weight/depth to limit settling. Both require dry cavities and good sequencing.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Dense-pack cellulose**:
  - Preferred for high-performance walls, especially cold or mixed climates
  - Adds air resistance and moisture buffering in one layer; lower embodied impact

- **Blown-in fiberglass**:
  - Acceptable when **budget is tight** and air-sealing is robust and verified
  - Insulates only; air control must be handled elsewhere. Treat insulation as part of the air and moisture system, not a standalone layer.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Cellulose works with the wall. Fiberglass depends on everything else being done right.*
