## InsightBox — Dense-Pack Cellulose vs Blown-In Fiberglass

### At a glance

This comparison looks at **dense-pack cellulose** versus **blown-in fiberglass** for wall cavities and enclosed assemblies.

Both are commonly used in new construction and retrofits. The differences show up in **air control, embodied impact, moisture behavior, and real-world performance consistency**.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Embodied energy & carbon**

- **Dense-Pack Cellulose**
  - Made primarily from **recycled paper fiber** with borate treatment.
  - Very low manufacturing energy; often produced regionally.
  - Acts as a **biogenic carbon store**, locking carbon into the building for decades.
- **Blown-In Fiberglass**
  - Made from sand and recycled glass.
  - Higher melt temperatures than cellulose → **higher embodied energy**.
  - No carbon storage benefit.

**Transport & installation**

- Both materials ship compressed and are blown with similar equipment.
- Cellulose is denser and heavier per cavity, slightly increasing transport weight.
- Installation energy is low for both.

**End of life**

- **Cellulose** can be vacuumed out and landfilled with relatively low impact.
- **Fiberglass** is harder to reclaim cleanly and typically becomes mixed waste.

> **LIS verdict:**  
> **Dense-pack cellulose has a clear lifecycle advantage**, driven by recycled content, carbon storage, and low manufacturing energy.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Air control & performance**

- **Dense-Pack Cellulose**
  - Installed at high density, it **reduces air movement within cavities**.
  - Helps limit convective looping and thermal bypass.
  - More forgiving of minor detailing imperfections.
- **Blown-In Fiberglass**
  - Highly air-permeable.
  - Performance depends heavily on **separate air-sealing layers** being flawless.
  - Susceptible to settling if not installed carefully.

**Moisture behavior**

- **Cellulose**
  - Hygroscopic: can absorb, redistribute, and release small amounts of moisture.
  - Supports vapor-open assemblies when kept within safe moisture ranges.
- **Fiberglass**
  - Does not buffer moisture.
  - Air movement through the insulation can carry moisture to cold surfaces.

**Durability & adaptability**

- Dense-pack cellulose resists settling when properly installed.
- Both materials can be removed for repairs, but cellulose is easier to reclaim and reuse during retrofits.

> **RIS verdict:**  
> **Dense-pack cellulose scores higher** for air control, moisture buffering, and resilience in real-world assemblies.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**

- **Blown-In Fiberglass**
  - Often the **lowest-cost cavity insulation**.
  - Fast installation with widely available crews.
- **Dense-Pack Cellulose**
  - Slightly higher cost due to material density and installation time.
  - Requires trained installers to hit proper density targets.

**Value over time**

- Cellulose’s air-restricting behavior can reduce heating and cooling loads without relying solely on membranes and tapes.
- Fiberglass can perform well **only when paired with excellent air-sealing** and quality control.

> **CPI verdict:**  
> **Cellulose delivers better cost-per-impact** by combining insulation and air-control benefits in one material, even if upfront costs are modestly higher.

### Summary Takeaway

- **Default choice for high-performance walls:**
  - **Dense-pack cellulose**, especially in cold or mixed climates.
- **When fiberglass is acceptable:**
  - Budget-driven projects with **robust, verified air-sealing strategies**.
- **Design guidance:**
  - Treat insulation as part of an **air + moisture system**, not a standalone layer.
  - If using fiberglass, air control must be handled elsewhere — perfectly.

**Builder’s rule of thumb:**  
> *Cellulose works with the wall. Fiberglass depends on everything else working perfectly.*
