## InsightBox — Air Sealing vs More Insulation

### At a glance

This comparison looks at two common upgrade strategies:
- **Adding more insulation**
- **Improving air sealing**

Both reduce energy use in different ways; in many buildings, air sealing delivers more value per dollar than adding insulation alone.

**Core idea:**  
Insulation slows heat flow.  
Air sealing stops heat *and* moisture from moving uncontrollably.  
In most buildings, air sealing comes first.

### Lifecycle Impact (LIS)

**Heat loss mechanisms**
- Insulation addresses **conduction**.
- Air leakage drives **convection**, which often accounts for a surprisingly large share of real-world heat loss.

**Diminishing returns**
- Adding insulation to a leaky building often delivers less benefit than expected.
- Sealing leaks allows existing insulation to perform closer to its rated value.

**Material efficiency**
- Air sealing typically uses small amounts of sealants, tapes, or membranes.
- Adding insulation increases material volume, embodied energy, and installation labor.

> **LIS takeaway:**  
> Air sealing often delivers **larger performance gains with less material impact** than adding more insulation alone.

### Regenerative Impact (RIS)

**Moisture control**
- Air leakage carries moisture into wall and roof assemblies.
- Air sealing reduces condensation risk and helps protect sheathing and framing over time.

**Comfort and health**
- Fewer drafts
- More even temperatures
- Better control of indoor air quality when paired with intentional ventilation

**System resilience**
- A tighter building envelope makes HVAC sizing more predictable and efficient.
- Air sealing supports low-energy, low-carbon mechanical systems.

> **RIS takeaway:**  
> Air sealing improves **durability, comfort, and long-term system stability**, not just energy numbers.

### Cost & CPI (Cost Per Impact)

**Up-front cost**
- Air sealing is often inexpensive relative to insulation:
  - Caulking, tapes, gaskets, membranes
  - Focused labor rather than bulk materials
- Insulation upgrades can be costly, especially when walls or roofs must be opened.

**Return on investment**
- Air sealing frequently delivers faster payback.
- It also reduces the amount of insulation needed to hit performance targets.

> **CPI takeaway:**  
> When choosing where to invest first, air sealing typically provides **better impact per dollar** than adding insulation.

### Performance notes

- Blower door testing and thermal imaging help prioritize where sealing matters most; insulation R-value alone understates real-world loss when leakage is high.

### Installation & risk

- Air sealing depends on continuity (sealants, tapes, gaskets, membranes) and build sequence; gaps undermine results.
- Adding insulation to a leaky assembly often yields diminishing returns and can mask moisture and draft issues.

---

### Summary Takeaway

- **More insulation**:
  - Helps, but only after air leaks are addressed
  - Subject to diminishing returns in leaky buildings

- **Air sealing**:
  - Reduces heat loss, moisture movement, and drafts
  - Improves comfort and protects the structure
  - Enables insulation to actually do its job

**Builder's rule of thumb:**  
> *You can't insulate a hole — seal first, then insulate.*
