# Experimental Systems Index

## What “Experimental” Means

Experimental systems are modeled assemblies that are buildable in principle but lack large-scale field validation. Materials data is used to calculate the Lifecycle Impact Score (LIS), while the Regenerative Impact Score (RIS) is treated as modeled with medium confidence. Builders should coordinate with engineers and local code officials before using these systems in live projects.

## Current Experimental Systems

### ResiliMass Wall (6/4/6)

- **Type:** Composite mass wall assembly
- **Layers:** 6" stabilized rammed earth (structural) + 4" continuous insulation + 6" hempcrete (non-structural)
- **Climate band:** CZ5–CZ7 (cold and mixed-cold climates)
- **Modeled center-of-wall R-value:** ~R-33 to R-35 (depending on insulation type)
- **Status:** Pilot-ready; recommended for engineered custom projects and owner-builds that can tolerate emerging assemblies.
- **Reference InsightBox:** ResiliMass_Wall_6-4-6.md

## Usage Notes

- Experimental systems are meant for exploration, education, and early adopters.
- They should not be treated as prescriptive code details.
- As field data accumulates, systems may be promoted from Experimental → Validated or revised/retired.
