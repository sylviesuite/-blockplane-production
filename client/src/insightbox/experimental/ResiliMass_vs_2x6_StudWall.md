# Experimental InsightBox — ResiliMass vs 2×6 Stud Wall

## System Status
- ResiliMass Wall (6/4/6): 🟡 Experimental — Composite Mass Wall Assembly
- 2×6 Stud Wall: 🟢 Standard — Conventional Light Wood Frame

## Summary Takeaway

ResiliMass trades a heavy, thermal-mass exterior with a breathable interior for higher modeled R-values, reduced long-term carbon, and a moisture-buffered environment. It is still experimental—best for engineered pilots and owner-builders who can coordinate the specialized crews and documentation. The conventional 2×6 wall remains the familiar, code-aligned baseline: easier to price, inspect, and permit, with predictable energy performance when detailed correctly.

## Assemblies Compared

### ResiliMass Wall (6/4/6)
- Layers: 6" stabilized rammed earth (structural) + 4" continuous insulation (mineral wool or wood fiber) + 6" hempcrete (non-structural, vapor-open) + lime plaster interior.
- Center-of-wall R-value (modeled): ~R-33 to R-35 depending on insulation.
- Climate band: CZ5–CZ7.
- Status: Experimental; suitable for engineered custom projects and pilots.

### 2×6 SPF Stud Wall (Reference)
- Typical assembly: exterior cladding + WRB + 7/16" OSB sheathing + 2×6 studs @ 16" o.c. with mineral wool or fiberglass batts + interior gypsum board with paint.
- Nominal cavity R-value: ~R-19 to R-21.
- Whole-wall R-value (framing + sheathing): typically in the R-15 to R-18 range.
- Status: Standard; widely used, familiar to builders, inspectors, and energy raters.

## Thermal Performance

- ResiliMass: modeled center-of-wall R-33–35, continuous insulation eliminates stud bridges, and massive rammed earth plus interior hempcrete slow heat fluctuations while buffering humidity.
- 2×6 stud wall: lower whole-wall R because of thermal bridging, less mass, and quicker response to outdoor swings; performance depends on air sealing and cavity fill.
- Occupant comfort: ResiliMass feels warmer in winter and cooler in summer thanks to mass and humidity buffering; standard studs can feel cold on the interior surface if air sealing and insulation are imperfect.
- Experimental note: ResiliMass performance is modeled, not yet verified at scale.

## LIS / Embodied Carbon & Materials

- ResiliMass: local stabilized earth, mineral wool or wood fiber insulation, and hempcrete keep synthetic content low; initial labor is higher, but calculated LIS leans lower over the full lifecycle, with a RIS story tied to mass, breathability, and biogenic content.
- 2×6 stud wall: kiln-dried lumber, fiberglass/mineral wool, OSB, drywall, and fasteners—everything is optimized for scale, which keeps embodied carbon moderate despite high synthetic content.
- ResiliMass LIS uses known material inputs but remains tagged experimental because of limited built examples and field data.

## Moisture & Durability

- ResiliMass: hempcrete interior and lime plaster form a vapor-open, moisture-buffering finish; dew point is controlled near the insulation layer, and the mass exterior shields the assembly from short wetting events. There are fewer hidden cavities for moisture to accumulate.
- 2×6 stud wall: effective when flashing, drainage, and air barriers are tight; vulnerability is higher if bulk water breaches the WRB or air leaks carry moisture into cavity insulation, risking rot or mold.
- Both systems still require good flashing, roof overhangs, and vigilant detailing at penetrations.

## Cost & Constructability (High-Level)

- ResiliMass:
  * Higher design and engineering overhead.
  * Requires rammed earth expertise, hempcrete know-how, and mecanized compaction workflow.
  * Labor savings may appear once the workflow is dialed, but it remains advanced for most crews.
- 2×6 stud wall:
  * Lowest friction choice for most projects.
  * Every builder, inspector, and supplier understands it.
  * Easy to price, schedule, and permit.
- Note: this is not a cost quote—just relative familiarity and difficulty.

## Experimental Notes & Caveats

- ResiliMass is an experimental system in BlockPlane. All performance values are modeled or derived from known material properties, not from large datasets of built projects.
- Projects using ResiliMass should be coordinated with a licensed engineer, experienced crews, and local code officials.
- The 2×6 wall remains the standard benchmark for cost, code compliance, and permitting.
