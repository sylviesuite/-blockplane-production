# Experimental InsightBox — ResiliMass Wall (6/4/6)

## System Status
🟡 Experimental — Composite Mass Wall Assembly

## Summary Takeaway

ResiliMass Wall (6/4/6) pairs a stabilized rammed earth exterior shell, mid-wall continuous insulation, and a vapor-open hempcrete infill to chase thermal mass, a tight envelope, and resilient interior comfort. The heavy rammed earth is the only load-bearing element; the interior hempcrete is non-structural and is attached via anchors that are embedded during the exterior pour (they do not carry gravity loads). This is a pilot-ready configuration best suited for owner-builders, custom homes, or engineered prototypes where both mass performance and hygroscopic breathability are priorities.

## Assembly Description

The system layers (from outside in) are:

- 6" stabilized rammed earth exterior wall (structural, moisture-tolerant, high thermal mass)
- 4" continuous insulation layer (mineral wool or wood fiber)
- 6" interior hempcrete infill (non-structural, vapor-open finish)

Embedded anchors cast into the rammed earth capture the insulation layer and hempcrete, but only provide mechanical connection—they are not sized for gravity loads. This keeps the rammed earth as the sole load-bearing element while allowing the interior mass to act as a passive climate buffer.

## Layer Breakdown

1. **Rammed earth (exterior, 6")** – Stabilized with a small percentage of low-carbon lime and/or cement, providing structural capacity, durability, and thermal inertia.
2. **Continuous insulation (4")** – Mineral wool or wood fiber board, bridging the thermal gap and reducing bridging into the hempcrete.
3. **Interior hempcrete (6")** – Non-structural hemp-lime mix that mediates indoor humidity, improves acoustic performance, and keeps the interior surface vapor-open.
4. **Embedded anchors** – Corrosion-resistant anchors set during the rammed earth pour, tapped into the insulation and hempcrete for stabilization (not for gravity).

## Thermal Performance (Modeled)

- Modeled center-of-wall R-value: ~R-33 to R-35 (climate target: CZ5–CZ7)
- Thermal mass of the rammed earth slows temperature swings while the hempcrete interior buffers humidity.
- The continuous insulation keeps the mass warm, preventing condensation risk even as the interior remains vapor-open.

## Lifecycle & Embodied Impact

- LIS is treated as fully calculated; the rammed earth carries most of the embodied mass, while the hempcrete and continuous insulation contribute lower-impact layers.
- The system trades a larger material volume for fewer synthetic materials compared to foam-heavy walls.
- TODO: insert field-measured embodied energy once ongoing test data is available.

## Constructability Notes

- Requires coordinated sequencing: exterior rammed earth pour must include anchors, insulation is mechanically anchored afterward, then the hempcrete is packed in from the interior.
- Skilled rammed earth crew plus experienced builders familiar with hempcrete mixes are essential to keep schedules tight.
- Anchors must be inspected before insulation and hempcrete placement to ensure alignment; they are not structural but they anchor the cladding system.

## Moisture & Durability Considerations

- The exterior rammed earth is moisture-tolerant and weather-resistant when finished properly; a breathable exterior seal (lime wash or mineral coating) helps deflect driving rain.
- The continuous insulation keeps the thermal mass warm while allowing the hempcrete to dry inward; the hempcrete itself dries slowly but remains vapor-open.
- Interior finishes should respect the breathability to avoid trapping moisture between layers.

## When This System Makes Sense

- Pilot projects, owner-builders, and custom residences seeking a mass wall with breathable finishes.
- Sites where daylight-driven thermal mass can be leveraged to store heat from passive solar gains.
- Applications where robustness (fire, pests) and indoor comfort outweigh the premium labor investment.

## Experimental Notes & Limitations

- RIS is modeled with medium confidence; ongoing field validation is required before general release.
- System performance remains climate-targeted to CZ5–CZ7; higher heat or humidity zones need additional verification.
- This is an emerging assembly—use for pilot projects with committed documentation and QA rather than speculative product campaigns.
